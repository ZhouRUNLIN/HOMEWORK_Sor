    "\n",
    "This is the first laboratory dedicated to Monte Carlo simulation on GPU. Monte Carlo simulation for linear problems is known to be suitable for parallel architectures. It is therefore a simple and realistic exercise to check the assimilation of the different concepts introduced during the course as well as in the other practical exercises. The first and most important element of Monte Carlo is the choice of the appropriate random number generator (RNG). RNGs are statically defined by a known inductive expression and dynamically specified by their state. In a parallel implementation, if we associate an RNG with each thread, the size of the state becomes an issue. Indeed, a large state multiplied by the number of threads occupies a significant cache memory space, and the latter becomes less available for other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NP function is used to check the simulation results and thus it should not be modified.\n",

    "As usual, do not forget to use CUDA documentation, especially:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) the specifications of CUDA API functions within the [CUDA_Runtime_API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html).\n",
    "2) the examples of how to use the CUDA API functions in [CUDA_C_Programming_Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add to this,\n",
    "\n",
    "3) the documentation of the CUDA random number generation library [cuRAND Library](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/curand/index.html).\n"
