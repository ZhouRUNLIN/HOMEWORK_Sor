    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to the use of different memory spaces available on the device. The example presented here is an approximation of the Normal cumulative distribution function that involves the value of some parameters. We consider storing these parameters in global memory, local memory, and registers. <b>Keep in mind that this is only an exercise in which we show how to use each type of memory space. Indeed, from the beginning of this lab, we already know that the best option for this function is to use registers!</b>\n",

    "The presented example will be continued, in another session, with the use of other memory spaces on the device.\n",
