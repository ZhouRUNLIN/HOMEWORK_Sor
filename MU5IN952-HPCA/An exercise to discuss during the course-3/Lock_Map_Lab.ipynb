    "## 14.1 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this lab is to show additional options for memory allocation on the host memory. We already know the usual pageable memory space allocated with malloc and the unified memory that, depending on the example, can be located on the host memory. The benefits of using locked and mapped memory allocations on the host depend mainly on the considered applications. However, there are at least two situations for which locked and mapped are difficult to replace: (i) asynchronous data transfer using locked memory, (ii) virtually extending the device RAM using mapped memory. In the following exercise, we see what is the syntax associated with each one of these options.\n",
