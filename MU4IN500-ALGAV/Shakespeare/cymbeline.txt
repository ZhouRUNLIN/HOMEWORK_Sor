enter
two
gentlemen
first
gentleman
you
do
not
meet
a
man
but
frowns
our
bloods
no
more
obey
the
heavens
than
our
courtiers
still
seem
as
does
the
king
second
gentleman
but
what
s
the
matter
first
gentleman
his
daughter
and
the
heir
of
s
kingdom
whom
he
purposed
to
his
wife
s
sole
son
a
widow
that
late
he
married
hath
referr
d
herself
unto
a
poor
but
worthy
gentleman
she
s
wedded
her
husband
banish
d
she
imprison
d
all
is
outward
sorrow
though
i
think
the
king

touch
d
at
very
heart
second
gentleman
none
but
the
king
first
gentleman
he
that
hath
lost
her
too
so
is
the
queen
that
most
desired
the
match
but
not
a
courtier
although
they
wear
their
faces
to
the
bent
of
the
king
s
look
s
hath
a
heart
that
is
not
glad
at
the
thing
they
scowl
at
second
gentleman
and
why
so
first
gentleman
he
that
hath
miss
d
the
princess
is
a
thing
too
bad
for
bad
report
and
he
that
hath
her
i
mean
that
married
her
alack
good
man
and
therefore
banish
d
is
a
creature
such
as
to
seek
through
the
regions
of
the
earth
for
one
his
like
there
would
be
something
failing
in
him
that
should
compare
i
do
not
think
so
fair
an
outward
and
such
stuff
within
endows
a
man
but
he
second
gentleman
you
speak
him
far
first
gentleman
i
do
extend
him
sir
within
himself
crush
him
together
rather
than
unfold
his
measure
duly
second
gentleman
what
s
his
name
and
birth
first
gentleman
i
cannot
delve
him
to
the
root
his
father
was
call
d
sicilius
who
did
join
his
honour
against
the
romans
with
cassibelan
but
had
his
titles
by
tenantius
whom
he
served
with
glory
and
admired
success
so
gain
d
the
sur
addition
leonatus
and
had
besides
this
gentleman
in
question
two
other
sons
who
in
the
wars
o
the
time
died
with
their
swords
in
hand
for
which
their
father
then
old
and
fond
of
issue
took
such
sorrow
that
he
quit
being
and
his
gentle
lady
big
of
this
gentleman
our
theme
deceased
as
he
was
born

to
his
protection

him
and
makes
him
of
his
bed
chamber
puts
to
him
all
the
learnings
that
his
time
could
make
him
the
receiver
of
which
he
took
as
we
do
air
fast
as
twas
minister
d
and
in
s
spring
became
a
harvest
lived
in
court
which
rare
it
is
to
do
most
praised
most
loved
a
sample
to
the
youngest
to
the
more
mature

glass
that
feated

and
to
the
graver
a
child
that

dotards
to
his

be
truly
read
what
kind
of
man

his
only
child
he
had
two
sons
if
this
be
worth
your
hearing

years

i
the
swathing

the
other
from

n
and
to
this
hour
no
guess
in

which
way
they
went
second
gentleman
how
long
is
this
ago
first
gentleman
some
twenty
years
second
gentleman
that
a
king
s
children
should
be
so
convey
d
so
slackly
guarded
and
the
search
so
slow
that

not
trace
them
first

howsoe
er

strange

him
from

he
did
keep
the
deck
with
glove

diminution
of

d
him
till
he
had
melted
from
the
smallness
of
a
gnat
to
air
and
then

and
wept
but

pretty
things
to

ere
i
could
tell
him
how
i
would
think
on
him
at
certain
hours
such
thoughts
and
such
or
i
could
make
him
swear
the
shes
of
italy
should
not
betray
mine
interest
and
his
honour
or
have
charged
him
at
the
sixth
hour
of

at
noon
at
midnight
to
encounter
me
with
orisons
for
then
i
am
in

iachimo
a
frenchman
a
dutchman
and
a
spaniard
iachimo
believe
it
sir
i
have
seen
him
in
britain
he
was
then
of
a
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
but
i
could
then
have
looked
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
i
to
peruse
him
by
items
philario
you
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnished
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without

within
frenchman
i
have
seen
him
in
france
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
iachimo
this
matter
of
marrying
his
king
s
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
i
doubt
not
a
great
deal
from
the
matter
frenchman
and
then
his
banishment
iachimo
ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
a
beggar
without
less
quality
but
how
comes

mine
how
worthy
he
is
i
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
frenchman
sir
we
have
known
together
in
orleans
posthumus
leonatus
since
when
i
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
i
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
frenchman
sir
you
o
er
rate
my
poor
kindness
i
was
glad
i
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
a
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
a
nature
posthumus
leonatus
by
your
pardon
sir
i
was
then
a
young
traveller
rather
shunned
to
go
even
with
what
i
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
judgment
if
i
offend
not
to
say
it
is
mended
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
frenchman
faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
fallen
both
iachimo
can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
frenchman
safely
i
think
twas
a
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
it
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
vouching
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
affirmation
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
france
iachimo
that
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
gentleman
s
opinion
by
this
worn
out
posthumus
leonatus
she
holds
her
virtue
still
and
i
my
mind
iachimo
you
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
italy
posthumus
leonatus
being
so
far
provoked
as
i
was
in
france
i
would
abate
her
nothing
though
i
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
iachimo
as
fair
and
as
good
a
kind
of
hand
in
hand
comparison
had
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
britain
if
she
went
before
others
i
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
i
have
beheld
i
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
i
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
posthumus
leonatus
i
praised
her
as
i
rated
her
so
do
i
my
stone
iachimo
what
do
you
esteem
it
at
posthumus
leonatus
more
than
the
world
enjoys
iachimo
either
your
unparagoned
mistress
is
dead
or
she
s
outprized
by
a
trifle
posthumus
leonatus
you
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
a
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
iachimo
which
the
gods
have
given
you
posthumus
leonatus
which
by
their
graces
i
will
keep
iachimo
you
may
wear
her
in
title
yours
but
you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
your
ring
may
be
stolen
too
so
your
brace
of
unprizable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
casual
a
cunning
thief
or
a
that
way
accomplished
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first
and
last
posthumus
leonatus
your
italy
contains
none
so
accomplished
a
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my
mistress
if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
i
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
i
fear
not
my
ring
philario
let
us
leave
here
gentlemen
posthumus
leonatus
sir
with
all
my
heart
this
worthy
signior
i
thank
him
makes
no
stranger
of
me
we
are
familiar
at
first
iachimo
with
five
times
so
much
conversation
i
should
get
ground
of
your
fair
mistress
make
her
go
back
even
to
the
yielding
had
i
admittance
and
opportunity
to
friend
posthumus
leonatus
no
no
iachimo
i
dare
thereupon
pawn
the
moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
o
ervalues
it
something
but
i
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
i
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
posthumus
leonatus
you
are
a
great
deal
abused
in
too
bold
a
persuasion
and
i
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
you
re
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
iachimo
what
s
that
posthumus
leonatus
a
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserve
more
a
punishment
too
philario
gentlemen
enough
of
this
it
came
in
too
suddenly
let
it
die
as
it
was
born
and
i
pray
you
be
better
acquainted
iachimo
would
i
had
put
my
estate
and
my
neighbour
s
on
the
approbation
of
what
i
have
spoke
posthumus
leonatus
what
lady
would
you
choose
to
assail
iachimo
yours
whom
in
constancy
you
think
stands
so
safe
i
will
lay
you
ten
thousand
ducats
to
your
ring
that
commend
me
to
the
court
where
your
lady
is
with
no
more
advantage
than
the
opportunity
of
a
second
conference
and
i
will
bring
from
thence
that
honour
of
hers
which
you
imagine
so
reserved
posthumus
leonatus
i
will
wage
against
your
gold
gold
to
it
my
ring
i
hold
dear
as
my
finger
tis
part
of
it
iachimo
you
are
afraid
and
therein
the
wiser
if
you
buy
ladies
flesh
at
a
million
a
dram
you
cannot
preserve
it
from
tainting
but
i
see
you
have
some
religion
in
you
that
you
fear
posthumus
leonatus
this
is
but
a
custom
in
your
tongue
you
bear
a
graver
purpose
i
hope
iachimo
i
am
the
master
of
my
speeches
and
would
undergo
what
s
spoken
i
swear
posthumus
leonatus
will
you
i
shall
but
lend
my
diamond
till
your
return
let
there
be
covenants
drawn
between
s
my
mistress
exceeds
in
goodness
the
hugeness
of
your
unworthy
thinking
i
dare
you
to
this
match
here
s
my
ring
philario
i
will
have
it
no
lay
iachimo
by
the
gods
it
is
one
if
i
bring
you
no
sufficient
testimony
that
i
have
enjoyed
the
dearest
bodily
part
of
your
mistress
my
ten
thousand
ducats
are
yours
so
is
your
diamond
too
if
i
come
off
and
leave
her
in
such
honour
as
you
have
trust
in
she
your
jewel
this
your
jewel
and
my
gold
are
yours
provided
i
have
your
commendation
for
my
more
free
entertainment
posthumus

i
embrace
these
conditions
let
us
have
articles
betwixt
us
only
thus
far
you
shall
answer
if
you
make
your
voyage
upon
her
and
give
me
directly
to
understand
you
have
prevailed
i
am
no
further
your
enemy
she
is
not
worth
our
debate
if
she
remain
unseduced
you
not
making
it
appear
otherwise
for
your
ill
opinion
and
the
assault
you
have
made
to
her
chastity
you
shall
answer
me
with
your
sword
iachimo
your
hand
a
covenant
we
will
have
these
things
set
down
by
lawful
counsel
and
straight
away
for
britain
lest
the
bargain
should
catch
cold
and
starve

will
fetch
my
gold

have
our
two
wagers

ay
here
they
are
madam
presenting
a
small
box
but
i
beseech
your
grace
without
offence
my
conscience
bids
me
ask
wherefore
you
have
commanded
of
me
those
most
poisonous
compounds
which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
but
though
slow
deadly
queen
i
wonder

thou
ask

such
a
question

me

so
that
our
great

doth
woo
me
oft
for
my
confections
having
thus
far
proceeded
unless
thou
think
st
me
devilish
is
t
not
meet
that
i
did
amplify
my
judgment
in
other
conclusions
i
will
try
the
forces
of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
we
count
not
worth
the
hanging
but
none
human
to
try
the
vigour
of
them
and
apply
allayments
to
their
act
and
by
them
gather
their
several
virtues
and
effects
cornelius
your
highness
shall
from
this
practise
but
make
hard
your
heart

the
seeing
these

noisome

[to

hark
thee
a
word
cornelius
[aside]
i
do
not
like
her
she
doth
think
she
has
strange
lingering
poisons
i
do
know
her
spirit
and
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
a
drug
of
such
damn
d
nature
those
she
has
will
stupefy
and
dull
the
sense
awhile
which
first
perchance
she
ll
prove
on
cats
and
dogs
then
afterward
up
higher
but
there
is
no
danger
in
what
show
of

it
makes
more
than
the
locking
up

spirits
a

to
be

most
false

welcome
sir

your

is
one
of
the
fairest
that
i
have
look

upon

therewithal
the

be
false
with

iachimo
here
are
letters
for
you
posthumus

their
tenor
good
i
trust
iachimo
tis
very
like
philario
was
caius
lucius
in
the
britain
court
when
you
were
there
iachimo
he
was
expected
then
but
not
approach
d
posthumus
leonatus
all
is
well
yet
sparkles
this
stone
as
it
was
wont
or
is
t
not
too
dull
for
your
good
wearing
iachimo
if
i
had
lost
it
i
should
have
lost
the
worth
of
it
in
gold
i
ll
make
a
journey
twice
as
far
to
enjoy
a
second
night
of
such
sweet
shortness
which
was
mine
in
britain
for
the
ring
is
won
posthumus
leonatus
the
stone
s
too
hard
to
come
by
iachimo
not
a
whit
your
lady
being
so
easy
posthumus
leonatus
make
not
sir
your
loss
your
sport
i
hope
you
know
that
we
must
not
continue
friends
iachimo
good
sir
we
must
if
you
keep
covenant
had
i
not
brought
the
knowledge
of
your
mistress
home
i
grant
we
were
to
question
further
but
i
now
profess
myself
the
winner
of
her
honour
together
with
your
ring
and
not
the
wronger
of
her
or
you
having
proceeded
but
by
both
your
wills
posthumus
leonatus
if
you
can
make
t
apparent
that
you
have
tasted
her
in
bed
my
hand
and
ring
is
yours
if
not
the
foul
opinion
you
had
of
her
pure
honour
gains
or
loses
your
sword
or
mine
or
masterless
leaves
both
to
who
shall
find
them
iachimo
sir
my
circumstances
being
so
near
the
truth
as
i
will
make
them
must
first
induce
you
to
believe
whose
strength
i
will
confirm
with
oath
which
i
doubt
not
you
ll
give
me
leave
to
spare
when
you
shall
find
you
need
it
not
posthumus
leonatus
proceed
iachimo
first
her
bedchamber
where
i
confess
i
slept
not
but
profess
had
that
was
well
worth
watching
it
was
hang
d
with
tapesty
of
silk
and
silver
the
story
proud
cleopatra
when
she
met
her
roman
and
cydnus
swell
d
above
the
banks
or
for
the
press
of
boats
or
pride
a
piece
of
work
so
bravely
done
so
rich
that
it
did
strive
in
workmanship
and
value
which
i
wonder
d
could
be
so
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
since
the
true
life
on
t
was
posthumus
leonatus
this
is
true
and
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me
or
by
some
other
iachimo
more
particulars
must
justify
my
knowledge
posthumus
leonatus
so
they
must
or
do
your
honour
injury
iachimo
the
chimney
is
south
the
chamber
and
the
chimney
piece
chaste
dian
bathing
never
saw
i
figures
so
likely
to
report
themselves
the
cutter
was
as
another
nature
dumb
outwent
her
motion
and
breath
left
out
posthumus
leonatus
this
is
a
thing
which
you
might
from
relation
likewise
reap
being
as
it
is
much
spoke
of
iachimo
the
roof
o
the
chamber
with
golden
cherubins
is
fretted
her
andirons
i
had
forgot
them
were
two
winking
cupids
of
silver
each
on
one
foot
standing
nicely
depending
on
their
brands
posthumus
leonatus
this
is
her
honour
let
it
be
granted
you
have
seen
all
this
and
praise
be
given
to
your
remembrance
the
description
of
what
is
in
her
chamber
nothing
saves
the
wager
you
have
laid
iachimo
then
if
you
can
showing
the
bracelet
be
pale
i
beg
but
leave
to
air
this
jewel
see
and
now
tis
up
again
it
must
be
married
to
that
your
diamond
i
ll
keep
them
posthumus
leonatus
jove
once
more
let
me
behold
it
is
it
that
which
i
left
with
her
iachimo
sir
i
thank
her
that
she
stripp
d
it
from
her
arm
i
see
her
yet
her
pretty
action
did
outsell
her
gift
and
yet
enrich
d
it
too
she
gave
it
me
and
said
she
prized
it
once
posthumus
leonatus
may
be
she
pluck
d
it
off
to
send
it
me
iachimo
she
writes
so
to
you
doth
she
posthumus
leonatus
o
no
no
no
tis
true
here
take
this
too
gives
the
ring
it
is
a
basilisk
unto
mine
eye
kills
me
to
look
on
t
let
there
be
no
honour
where
there
is
beauty

where
semblance

where
there

the
vows
of
women
of
no
more
bondage

to
where
they
are
made

measure
false
philario
have
patience
sir
and
take
your
ring
again
tis
not
yet
won
it
may
be
probable
she
lost
it
or
who
knows
if
one
of
her
women
being
corrupted
hath
stol
n
it
from
her
posthumus
leonatus
very
true
and
so
i
hope
he
came
by
t
back
my
ring
render
to
me
some
corporal
sign
about
her
more
evident
than
this

true
i
am
sure
she
would
not
lose
it
her
attendants
are
all
sworn
and
honourable
they
induced
to
steal
it
and
by
a
stranger
no
he
hath
enjoyed
her
the
cognizance
of
her
incontinency

this
she
hath
bought
the

thus
dearly
there
take
thy
hire
and
all
the
fiends

themselves
between

believed
of
one
persuaded
well
of

never
talk
on

she
hath
been
colted
by
him
iachimo
if
you

mole
right
proud
of
that
most
delicate
lodging

remember
sir
my

the

your

together
with
the
natural
bravery
of
your
isle
which
stands
as
neptune

park
ribbed
and
paled
in
with
rocks
unscalable
and
roaring
waters
with
sands
that
will
not
bear
your

boats
but
suck
them
up
to
the

a
kind
of
conquest
caesar
made
here
but
made
not
here
his
brag
of
came
and
saw
and
overcame
with
shame
that
first
that
ever
touch
d
him
he
was
carried
from
off
our
coast
twice
beaten
and
his
shipping
poor
ignorant
baubles
upon
our
terrible
seas
like
egg
shells
moved
upon
their
surges
crack
d
as
easily
gainst
our

for
joy
whereof
the
famed
cassibelan
who
was
once
at

o
giglot
fortune
to
master
caesar
s

made
lud
s

with

and
britons
strut
with

cloten
come
there
s
no
more
tribute
to

our
kingdom
is
stronger
than
it
was
at
that
time
and
as
i
said
there
is
no
moe
such
caesars
other
of
them
may
have
crook
d

but
to
owe
such
straight
arms
none
cymbeline
son
let
your

end
cloten
we
have
yet
many
among
us
can
gripe
as
hard
as
cassibelan
i
do
not
say
i
am
one
but
i
have
a
hand
why
tribute
why
should
we
pay
tribute
if
caesar
can
hide
the
sun
from
us
with
a
blanket
or
put
the
moon
in
his
pocket
we
will
pay
him
tribute
for
light
else
sir
no
more
tribute
pray
you
now
cymbeline
you
must
know
till
the
injurious
romans
did
extort
this
tribute
from
us
we
were
free
caesar
s
ambition
which
swell
d
so
much
that
it
did
almost
stretch
the
sides
o
the
world
against
all
colour
here
did
put
the
yoke
upon
s
which
to
shake
off
becomes
a
warlike
people
whom
we
reckon
ourselves
to
be
cloten
lords
we
do
cymbeline
say
then
to
caesar
our
ancestor
was
that
mulmutius
which
ordain
d
our
laws
whose
use
the
sword
of
caesar
hath
too
much
mangled
whose
repair
and
franchise
shall
by
the
power
we
hold
be
our
good
deed
though
rome
be
therefore
angry
mulmutius
made
our
laws
who
was
the
first
of
britain
which
did
put
his
brows
within
a
golden
crown
and
call
d
himself

why
hast
thou
abused

thine

our

inviting

to

good

hear
me
with
patience
imogen
talk
thy

i
have
heard
i

therein
false
struck
can
take
no

wound
nor
tent
to

that
but
speak

then
madam
i
thought
you
would
not
back
again
imogen
most
like
bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
pisanio
not
so
neither
but
if
i
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
my
purpose
would
prove
well
it
cannot
be
but
that
my
master
is
abused
some
villain
ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
this
cursed
injury
imogen
some
roman
courtezan
pisanio
no
on

i
ll
give

notice

send
him
some
bloody
sign
of
it
for

i
should
do
so
you
shall
be
miss
d

that
will

in

what
comfort
when
i
am
dead
to
my

pisanio
if
you
ll
back
to
the
court
imogen
no
court
no

nor
no
more
ado
with
that
harsh
noble
simple
nothing
that
cloten
whose
love
suit
hath
been
to
me
as
fearful
as
a

if

not

must
you
bide

as
your
fortune
is

but
disguise
that
which
to
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be

by
self
danger
you
should
tread
a
course
pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
haply
near
the
residence
of
posthumus
so
nigh
at

that
though
his
actions
were
not

yet

should
render
him
hourly
to
your

as
truly
as
he
moves
imogen
o
for
such
means
though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
on

i
would
adventure
pisanio
well
then
here
s
the
point
you
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
command
into
obedience
fear
and
niceness
the
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
woman
its
pretty
self
into
a
waggish
courage
ready
in
gibes
quick
answer
d
saucy
and
as
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
nay
you
must
forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
exposing
it
but
o
the
harder
heart
alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
of

glory
for

this
done
spurn
her

who
may
haply
be
a
little
angry
for

you
did
mistake
him
sure
belarius
i
cannot
tell
long
is
it
since
i
saw
him
but
time
hath
nothing
blurr
d
those
lines
of
favour
which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
and

of
speaking
were
as

i

absolute
twas
very
cloten
arviragus
in
this
place
we
left
them
i
wish
my
brother
make
good
time
with
him
you
say
he
is
so
fell
belarius
being
scarce
made
up
i
mean
to
man
he
had
not
apprehension
of
roaring
terrors
for
the
effect
of
judgment
is
oft
the
cause
of
fear
but
see
thy
brother
re
enter
guiderius
with
cloten
s
head
guiderius
this
cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
there
was
no
money
in
t
not
hercules
could
have
knock
d
out
his
brains
for
he
had
none
yet
i
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
my
head
as
i
do
his
belarius
what
hast
thou
done
guiderius
i
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
cloten
s
head
son
to
the
queen
after
his
own
report
who
call
d
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
with
his
own
single
hand
he
ld
take
us
in
displace
our
heads
where
thank
the
gods
they
grow
and
set
them
on
lud
s
town
belarius
we
are
all
undone
guiderius
why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
but
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
the
law
protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
to
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
for
we
do
fear
the
law
what
company
discover
you
abroad
belarius
no
single
soul
can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
all
safe
reason
he
must
have
some
attendants
though
his
humour
was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
from
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
raved
to
bring
him
here
alone
although
perhaps
it
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
may
make
some
stronger
head
the
which
he
hearing
as
it
is
like
him
might
break
out
and
swear
he
ld
fetch
us
in
yet
is
t
not
probable
to
come
alone
either
he
so
undertaking
or
they
so
suffering
then
on
good
ground
we
fear
if
we
do
fear
this
body
hath
a
tail
more
perilous
than

my

as
the
rudest
wind
that
by

doth
take
the

make

tis
wonder
that

unlearn

untaught
civility
not

from

still
it

the
great

in

when

point
at
me
her

gone
so
needful
for
this
present
it
strikes
me
past
the
hope
of

but
for
thee
fellow
who

must
know
of

departure
and

seem
so
ignorant
we
ll
enforce
it
from
thee
by
a
sharp
torture
pisanio
sir
my

yours
i

set
it
at

of

i

amazed

your

affront

than
what
you

to

thank
you
let

meet
the

what

the

this

a

in

nothing
becoming

it

thou

tis
still
a

or
else
such

not
either
both
or
nothing
or
senseless
speaking
or
a
speaking
such
as
sense
cannot
untie
be
what
it
is
the
action
of
my
life
is
like
it
which
i
ll
keep
if
but
for
sympathy
re
enter
first
gaoler
first
gaoler
come
sir
are
you
ready
for
death
posthumus
leonatus
over
roasted
rather
ready
long
ago
first
gaoler
hanging
is
the
word
sir
if
you
be
ready
for
that
you
are
well
cooked
posthumus
leonatus
so
if
i
prove
a
good
repast
to
the
spectators
the
dish
pays
the
shot
first
gaoler
a
heavy
reckoning
for
you
sir
but
the
comfort
is
you
shall
be
called
to
no
more
payments
fear
no
more
tavern
bills
which
are
often
the
sadness
of
parting
as
the
procuring
of
mirth
you
come
in
flint
for
want
of
meat
depart
reeling
with
too
much
drink
sorry
that
you
have
paid
too
much
and
sorry
that
you
are
paid
too
much
purse
and
brain
both
empty
the
brain
the
heavier
for
being
too
light
the
purse
too
light
being
drawn
of
heaviness
of
this
contradiction
you
shall
now
be
quit
o
the
charity
of
a
penny
cord
it
sums
up
thousands
in
a
trice
you
have
no
true
debitor
and
creditor
but
it
of
what
s
past
is
and
to
come
the
discharge
your
neck
sir
is
pen
book
and
counters
so
the
acquittance
follows
posthumus
leonatus
i
am
merrier
to
die
than
thou
art
to
live
first
gaoler
indeed
sir
he
that
sleeps
feels
not
the
tooth
ache
but
a
man
that
were
to
sleep
your
sleep
and
a
hangman
to
help
him
to
bed
i
think
he
would
change
places
with
his
officer
for
look
you
sir
you
know
not
which
way
you
shall
go
posthumus
leonatus
yes
indeed
do
i
fellow
first
gaoler
your
death
has
eyes
in
s
head
then
i
have
not
seen
him
so
pictured
you
must
either
be
directed
by
some
that
take
upon
them
to
know
or
do
take
upon
yourself
that
which
i
am
sure
you
do
not
know
or
jump
the
after
inquiry
on
your
own
peril
and
how
you
shall
speed
in
your
journey
s
end
i
think
you
ll
never
return
to
tell
one
posthumus
leonatus
i
tell
thee
fellow
there
are
none
want
eyes
to
direct
them
the
way
i
am
going
but
such
as
wink
and
will
not
use
them
first
gaoler
what
an
infinite
mock
is
this
that
a
man
should
have
the
best
use
of
eyes
to
see
the
way
of
blindness
i
am
sure
hanging

the
way
of
winking
enter

unless
a

would

on
my
conscience
there

yet
o

for

that

most
like
a

one
that
had
a
royal
lover
took
his
hint
and
not
dispraising
whom
we
praised
therein
he
was
as
calm
as
virtue
he
began
his

put
in

either
our

iachimo
your

there
it
begins
he
spake
of
her
as
dian
had
hot
dreams
and
she
alone
were

whereat
i
wretch
made
scruple
of
his
praise
and
wager
d
with
him
pieces
of
gold
gainst
this
which
then
he
wore
upon
his
honour

to
attain
in

win
this

no

in

well
may
you

remember
me

incivil
one
the
wrongs

did
me
were
nothing

merited
than
a

alone
they

why

too
far

so
soon

i
am
too
blunt
and
saucy
here

as
i
could
put
into

their
nurse
euriphile

for
the
theft
i
wedded

these
children
upon
my
banishment
i
moved
her
to
t
having
received
the
punishment
before
for
that
which
i
did
then
beaten
for
loyalty
excited
me
to
treason
their
dear
loss

more
of
you

more
it
shaped
unto
my
end
of
stealing
them

must
lose
two
of

on
their
heads

st
the
service
that
you

more

not
how
to
wish
