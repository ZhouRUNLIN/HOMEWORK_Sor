most
heedfully

awaked
an
evil

beget
of

a
falsehood
in

contrary
as
great

with

what

having
into

indeed
the

was
that
he
in

premises
of

and
i

not
how
much
tribute
should
presently
extirpate
me
and
mine
out
of

dukedom
and
confer
fair
milan
with
all
the
honours
on
my

whereon
a
treacherous
army
levied
one
midnight
fated
to

antonio
open
the

of

bloody
on

with
colours
fairer
painted

some
leagues
to

not
miss
t
adrian
it
must
needs
be
of
subtle
tender
and
delicate
temperance
antonio
temperance
was
a
delicate
wench
sebastian
ay
and
a
subtle
as
he
most
learnedly
delivered
adrian
the
air
breathes
upon
us
here
most
sweetly
sebastian
as
if
it
had
lungs
and
rotten
ones
antonio
or
as
twere
perfumed
by
a
fen
gonzalo
here
is
everything
advantageous
to
life
antonio
true
save
means
to
live
sebastian
of
that
there
s
none
or
little
gonzalo
how
lush
and
lusty
the
grass
looks
how
green
antonio
the
ground
indeed
is
tawny
sebastian
with
an
eye
of
green
in
t
antonio
he
misses
not
much
sebastian
no
he
doth
but
mistake
the
truth
totally
gonzalo
but
the
rarity
of
it
is
which
is
indeed
almost
beyond
credit
sebastian
as
many
vouched
rarities
are
gonzalo
that
our
garments
being
as
they
were
drenched
in
the
sea
hold
notwithstanding
their
freshness
and
glosses
being
rather
new
dyed
than
stained
with
salt
water
antonio
if
but
one
of
his
pockets
could
speak
would
it
not
say
he
lies
sebastian
ay
or
very
falsely
pocket
up
his
report
gonzalo
methinks
our
garments
are
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
put
them
on
first
in
afric
at
the
marriage
of
the
king
s
fair
daughter
claribel
to
the
king
of
tunis
sebastian
twas
a
sweet
marriage
and
we
prosper
well
in
our
return
adrian
tunis
was
never
graced
before
with
such
a
paragon
to
their
queen
gonzalo
not
since
widow
dido
s
time
antonio
widow
a
pox
o
that
how
came
that
widow
in
widow
dido
sebastian
what
if
he
had
said
widower
aeneas
too
good
lord
how
you
take
it
adrian
widow
dido
said
you
you
make
me
study
of
that
she
was
of
carthage
not
of
tunis
gonzalo
this
tunis
sir
was
carthage
adrian
carthage
gonzalo
i
assure
you
carthage
sebastian
his
word
is
more
than
the
miraculous
harp
he
hath
raised
the
wall
and
houses
too
antonio
what
impossible
matter
will
he
make
easy
next
sebastian
i
think
he
will
carry
this
island
home
in
his
pocket
and
give
it
his
son
for
an
apple
antonio
and
sowing
the
kernels
of
it
in
the
sea
bring
forth
more
islands
gonzalo
ay
antonio
why
in
good
time
gonzalo
sir
we
were
talking
that
our
garments
seem
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
were
at
tunis
at
the
marriage
of
your
daughter
who
is
now
queen
antonio
and
the
rarest
that
e
er
came
there
sebastian
bate
i
beseech
you
widow
dido
antonio
o
widow
dido
ay
widow
dido
gonzalo
is
not
sir
my
doublet
as
fresh
as
the
first
day
i
wore
it
i
mean
in
a
sort
antonio
that
sort
was
well
fished
for
gonzalo
when
i
wore
it
at
your
daughter
s
marriage
alonso
you
cram
these
words
into
mine
ears
against
the
stomach
of
my
sense
would
i
had
never
married
my
daughter
there
for
coming
thence
my
son
is
lost
and
in
my
rate
she
too
who
is
so
far
from
italy
removed
i
ne
er
again
shall
see
her
o
thou
mine
heir
of
naples
and
of
milan
what
strange
fish
hath
made
his
meal
on
thee
francisco
sir
he
may
live
i
saw
him
beat
the
surges
under
him
and
ride
upon
their
backs
he
trod
the
water
whose
enmity
he
flung
aside
and
breasted
the
surge
most
swoln
that
met
him
his
bold
head
bove
the
contentious
waves
he
kept
and
oar
d
himself
with
his
good
arms
in
lusty
stroke
to
the
shore
that
o
er
his
wave
worn
basis
bow
d
as
stooping
to
relieve
him
i
not
doubt
he
came
alive
to
land
alonso
no
no
he
s
gone
sebastian
sir
you
may
thank
yourself
for
this
great
loss
that
would
not
bless
our
europe
with
your
daughter
but
rather
lose
her
to
an
african
where
she
at
least
is
banish
d
from
your
eye
who
hath
cause
to
wet
the
grief
on
t
alonso
prithee
peace
sebastian
you
were
kneel
d
to
and
importuned
otherwise
by
all
of
us
and
the
fair
soul
herself
weigh
d
between
loathness
and
obedience
at
which
end
o
the
beam
should
bow
we
have
lost
your
son
i
fear
for
ever
milan
and
naples
have
more
widows
in
them
of
this
business
making
than
we
bring
men
to
comfort
them
the
fault
s
your
own
alonso
so
is
the
dear
st
o
the
loss
gonzalo
my
lord
sebastian
the
truth
you
speak
doth
lack
some
gentleness
and
time
to
speak
it
in
you
rub
the
sore
when
you
should
bring
the
plaster
sebastian
very
well
antonio
and
most
chirurgeonly
gonzalo
it
is
foul
weather
in
us
all
good
sir
when
you
are
cloudy
sebastian
foul

plantation
of
this
isle
my
lord
antonio
he
ld
sow
t
with
nettle
seed
sebastian
or
docks
or
mallows
gonzalo
and
were
the
king
on
t
what
would
i
do
sebastian
scape
being
drunk
for
want
of
wine
gonzalo
i
the
commonwealth
i
would
by
contraries
execute
all
things
for
no
kind
of
traffic
would
i
admit
no
name
of
magistrate
letters
should
not
be
known

none

none
no

he
would
be

on
t
antonio
the
latter
end
of
his
commonwealth
forgets
the
beginning
gonzalo
all
things
in

nature
should
produce
without
sweat
or
endeavour
treason
felony
sword
pike
knife
gun
or
need
of
any
engine
would
i
not
have
but

should
bring
forth
of
its
own
kind
all
foison
all
abundance
to
feed
my
innocent
people
sebastian
no
marrying
mong
his
subjects
antonio
none

weeks

inclined
to
do
so
sebastian

visits

why
doth
it
not
then
our
eyelids
sink
i
find
not
myself
disposed
to
sleep
antonio
nor
i
my
spirits
are
nimble
they
fell
together
all
as
by
consent
they
dropp
d
as
by
a
thunder
stroke
what
might
worthy

a
crown
dropping
upon
thy
head
sebastian
what
art
thou
waking
antonio
do
you
not
hear
me
speak
sebastian
i
do
and
surely
it
is
a
sleepy
language
and
thou
speak
st
out
of
thy
sleep
what
is
it
thou
didst
say
this
is
a
strange
repose
to
be
asleep
with
eyes
wide
open
standing
speaking
moving
and
yet
so
fast
asleep
antonio
noble
sebastian
thou
let

how
you
the
purpose

whiles
thus
you
mock

how
in
stripping

more
invest

men
indeed
most
often
do
so
near
the
bottom
run
by
their
own
fear
or
sloth
sebastian
prithee
say
on
the
setting
of
thine
eye
and

proclaim
a
matter
from
thee
and
a
birth
indeed
which
throes
thee
much
to
yield

who
shall
be
of

little
memory

full
many
a

many
a

the
harmony
of
their

into

brought
my
too
diligent
ear
for
several
virtues
have
i
liked
several
women
never
any
with
so
fun
soul
but
some
defect
in
her
did
quarrel
with
the
noblest
grace
she
owed
and
put
it
to
the
foil

you
o
you
so
perfect

so
peerless

quaint
device
the

you
are
three
men
of
sin
whom
destiny
that

to
instrument
this
lower
world
and
what
is
in

hath
caused
to
belch
up

men
being
most
unfit

you

my

invulnerable
if

your

remember
for
that
s
my
business
to
you
that
you
three
from
milan
did
supplant
good
prospero
exposed
unto
the
sea
which
hath
requit
it
him

his
innocent
child
for
which
foul
deed
the
powers
delaying
not

have
incensed
the
seas
and
shores
yea
all
the
creatures
against
your
peace
thee
of
thy
son
alonso
they
have
bereft
and
do
pronounce
by
me
lingering
perdition
worse
than
any
death
can
be
at
once
shall
step
by
step
attend
you
and
your
ways
whose
wraths
to
guard
you
from
which
here
in
this
most
desolate
isle
else
falls
upon
your
heads
is
nothing
but
heart
sorrow
and
a
clear
life
ensuing
he
vanishes
in
thunder
then
to
soft
music
enter
the
shapes
again
and
dance
with
mocks
and
mows
and
carrying
out
the
table
prospero
bravely
the
figure
of
this
harpy
hast
thou
perform
d
my
ariel
a
grace
it
had
devouring
of
my
instruction
hast
thou
nothing
bated
in
what
thou
hadst
to
say
so
with
good
life
and
observation
strange
my
meaner
ministers
their
several
kinds
have
done
my
high
charms
work
and
these
mine
enemies
are
all
knit
up
in
their
distractions
they
now
are
in
my
power
and
in
these
fits
i
leave
them
while
i
visit
young
ferdinand

they
suppose
is
drown
d

his
and
mine
loved
darling
exit
above
gonzalo
i
the
name
of
something
holy
sir
why
stand
you
in
this
strange
stare
alonso
o
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
methought
the
billows
spoke
and
told
me
of
it
the
winds
did
sing
it
to
me
and
the
thunder
that
deep
and
dreadful
organ
pipe
pronounced
the
name
of
prosper
it
did
bass
my
trespass
therefore
my
son
i
the
ooze
is
bedded

with

like
poison
given
to

a
great
time
after

gins
to
bite
the

i
do
beseech
you
that
are
of
suppler
joints
follow

swiftly
and
hinder

from
what
this
ecstasy
may
now
provoke
them
to

if
i
have
too
austerely
punish
d
you
your
compensation
makes
amends
for
i
have
given
you
here
a
third
of
mine
own
life
or
that
for
which
i
live
who
once
again
i
tender
to
thy
hand
all
thy
vexations
were
but
my
trials
of
thy
love
and
thou
hast
strangely
stood
the
test
here
afore
heaven
i
ratify
this
my
rich
gift
o
ferdinand
do
not
smile
at
me
that
i
boast
her
off
for
thou
shalt
find
she
will
outstrip
all
praise
and
make
it
halt
behind
her
ferdinand
i
do
believe
it
against
an
oracle
prospero
then
as
my
gift
and
thine
own
acquisition
worthily
purchased
take
my
daughter
but
if
thou
dost
break
her
virgin
knot
before
all
sanctimonious
ceremonies
may
with
full
and
holy
rite
be

d
no
sweet
aspersion
shall
the
heavens
let

disdain
and
discord
shall
bestrew
the
union
of
your

with

so
loathly
that
you
shall
hate
it
both
therefore
take
heed
as

shall
light
you

hope
for
quiet

fair

my
mind
amends
with
which
i
fear
a
madness
held
me
this
must
crave

at
all
a
most
strange
story
thy
dukedom
i
resign
and
do
entreat
thou
pardon
me
my
wrongs
but
how
should
prospero
be
living
and
be
here

embrace
thine
age

some
subtilties
o
the
isle
that
will
not
let
you
believe
things
certain
welcome
my
friends
all
aside
to
sebastian
and
antonio
but
you
my
brace
of
lords
were
i
so
minded
i
here
could
pluck
his
highness
frown
upon
you
and
justify
you
traitors
at
this
time
i
will
tell
no
tales
sebastian
[aside]
the
devil
speaks
in
him
prospero
no
for
you
most
wicked
sir
whom
to
call
brother
would
even
infect
my
mouth
i
do
forgive
thy
rankest
fault
all
of
them
and
require
my
dukedom
of
thee
which
perforce
i
know
thou
must
restore
alonso
if
thou
be
st
prospero
give
us
particulars
of
thy
preservation
how
thou
hast
met
us
here
who
three
hours
since
were
wreck
d
upon
this
shore
where
i
have
lost
how
sharp
the
point
of
this
remembrance
is
my
dear
son
ferdinand
prospero
i
am
woe
for
t
sir
alonso
irreparable
is
the
loss
and
patience
says
it
is
past
her
cure
prospero
i
rather
think
you
have
not
sought
her
help
of
whose
soft
grace
for
the
like
loss
i
have
her
sovereign
aid
and
rest
myself
content
alonso
you
the
like
loss
prospero
as
great
to
me
as
late
and
supportable
to
make
the

means
much
weaker
than
you
may
call

comfort
you
for
i
have
lost
my
daughter
alonso

oozy
bed
where
my
son
lies
when
did
you
lose
your
daughter
prospero
in
this
last
tempest
i
perceive
these
lords
at
this
encounter

so
much
admire
that
they
devour
their
reason
and
scarce
think
their
eyes
do
offices
of
truth
their
words
are
natural
breath
but
howsoe
er
you
have
been
justled
from
your
senses

for
certain
that

am
prospero
and

hours
is
she
the
goddess
that
hath
sever
d
us
and
brought

thus
together
ferdinand
sir
she
is
mortal
but
by
immortal
providence
she
s
mine
i
chose
her
when
i
could
not
ask
my
father

advice
nor
thought

not
burthen
our
remembrance
with
a
heaviness

crown
for

milan
thrust
from
milan
that
his
issue
should
become
kings
of
naples
o
rejoice
beyond
a
common
joy
and
set
it
down
with
gold
on
lasting
pillars
in
one
voyage
did
claribel
her
husband
find
at
tunis
and
ferdinand
her
brother
found
a
wife
where
he
himself
was
lost
prospero
his
dukedom
in
a
poor
isle
and
all
of
us
ourselves
when
no

me
your
