my

is
mortified

grosser
manner
of
these

he
throws
upon
the
gross

s
baser
slaves

i
pine
and
die
with
all
these
living

biron
i
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
so
much
dear
liege
i
have
already
sworn
that
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
but
there
are
other
strict
observances
as
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
and
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
and
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
the
which
i
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
and
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
and
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
day
when
i
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
and
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
day
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
o
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
ferdinand
your
oath
is
pass
d
to
pass
away
from
these
biron
let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
i
only
swore
to
study
with
your
grace
and
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
longaville
you
swore
to
that
biron
and
to
the
rest
biron
by
yea
and
nay
sir
then
i
swore
in
jest
what
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
ferdinand
why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
biron
things
hid
and
barr
d
you
mean
from
common
sense
ferdinand
ay
that
is
study
s
godlike
recompense
biron
come
on
then
i
will
swear
to
study
so
to
know
the
thing
i
am
forbid
to
know
as
thus
to
study
where
i
well
may
dine
when
i
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
when
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
or
having
sworn
too
hard
a
keeping
oath
study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
if
study
s
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
swear
me
to
this
and
i
will
ne
er
say
no
ferdinand
these
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
and
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
biron
why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
which
with
pain
purchased
doth
inherit
pain
as
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
to
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
so
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
by
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
and
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by

no
more

of
their
shining

than
those
that

not
what
they
are
too
much
to

to

rescues
thee
from

this
been
proclaimed

see
the
penalty
reads
on
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
who
devised
this
penalty
longaville
marry
that
did
i
biron
sweet
lord
and
why
longaville
to
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
biron
a
dangerous
law
against
gentility
reads
item
if
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
this
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
for
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
the
french
king
s
daughter
with
yourself
to
speak
a
maid
of
grace
and
complete
majesty
about
surrender
up
of
aquitaine
to
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
or
vainly
comes
the
admired
princess
hither
ferdinand
what
say
you
lords
why
this
was
quite
forgot
biron
so
study
evermore
is
overshot
while
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
it
doth
forget
to
do
the

it
should
and
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
tis
won
as
towns
with

so
won
so
lost
ferdinand
we
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
she
must
lie
here
on

necessity
biron
necessity

make
us
all
forsworn

so
to

i
write
my

he
that
breaks
them
in

in

green

your

intimate

thousand

the
one
half
of
an
entire
sum
disbursed
by
my
father
in
his
wars

say
that
he
or
we
as
neither
have
received
that
sum
yet
there
remains
unpaid
a
hundred
thousand
more
in
surety
of
the
which
one
part
of
aquitaine
is
bound
to
us
although
not
valued
to
the
money
s
worth
if
then
the
king
your
father
will
restore
but
that
one
half
which
is
unsatisfied
we
will
give
up
our
right
in
aquitaine
and
hold
fair
friendship
with
his
majesty
but
that
it
seems
he
little
purposeth
for
here
he
doth
demand
to
have
repaid
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
not
demands
on
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
to
have
his
title
live
in
aquitaine
which
we
much
rather
had
depart
withal
and
have
the
money
by
our
father
lent
than
aquitaine
so
gelded
as
it
is
dear
princess
were

his

your

where
is
the

that
we
must
stand

in
forester
hereby
upon
the
edge
of
yonder
coppice
a

where
you
may
make
the

thereupon
thou
speak
st
the

forester
pardon
me
madam
for
i
meant
not
so
princess
what
what
first
praise
me
and

not

alack
for
woe
forester
yes

fair

nay
never
paint
me
now
where
fair
is
not
praise
cannot
mend
the
brow
here
good
my
glass
take
this
for

more
than

fair
is
that
which

see
my

will
be
saved
by
merit

a
giving
hand
though
foul
shall
have
fair
praise
but
come
the
bow
now
mercy
goes
to
kill
and
shooting
well
is
then
accounted
ill
thus
will
i
save
my
credit
in
the
shoot
not
wounding
pity
would
not
let
me
do
t
if
wounding
then
it
was
to
show
my
skill
that
more
for
praise
than
purpose
meant
to
kill
and
out
of
question
so
it
is
sometimes
glory
grows
guilty
of
detested
crimes
when
for
fame
s
sake
for
praise
an
outward
part
we
bend
to
that
the
working
of
the
heart
as
i
for
praise
alone
now
seek
to
spill
the
poor
deer

blood
that
my

means
no
ill
boyet
do

untrained

rather
unlettered

to

my

he

as
it

he
hath
not

his
intellect
is
not
replenished
he
is
only
an
animal
only
sensible
in
the
duller
parts
and
such
barren
plants
are
set
before
us
that
we
thankful
should
be
which
we
of
taste
and
feeling
are
for
those
parts
that
do
fructify
in

more
than
he
for
as
it
would
ill
become
me
to
be
vain
indiscreet
or
a
fool
so
were
there
a

set
on
learning
to

omne

i
being

under

some
half
an

when
lo
to
interrupt
my
purposed
rest
toward

i
might

the

i
stole
into
a

overheard
what
you
shall
overhear
that
by
and
by
disguised
they
will
be
here
their
herald
is
a
pretty
knavish
page
that
well
by
heart
hath
conn
d
his
embassage
action
and
accent
did
they
teach
him
there
thus
must
thou
speak
and
thus
thy
body
bear
and
ever
and
anon
they
made
a
doubt
presence
majestical
would
put
him
out
for
quoth
the
king
an
angel
shalt
thou
see
yet
fear
not
thou
but
speak
audaciously
the
boy
replied
an
angel
is
not
evil
i
should
have
fear
d
her
had
she
been
a
devil
with
that
all
laugh
d
and
clapp
d
him
on
the
shoulder
making
the
bold
wag
by
their
praises
bolder
one
rubb
d
his
elbow
thus
and
fleer
d
and
swore
a
better
speech
was
never
spoke
before
another
with
his

and
his

cried
via

and
cried
all
goes
well
the
fourth
turn

on

and
down
he
fell
with
that
they
all
did
tumble
on
the
ground
with
such
a
zealous
laughter
so
profound
that
in
this
spleen
ridiculous
appears
to
cheque
their
folly
passion
s
solemn
tears
princess
but
what
but
what
come
they
to
visit
us
boyet
they
do
they
do
and
are
apparell
d
thus
like
muscovites
or
russians
as
i
guess
their
purpose
is
to
parle
to
court
and
dance
and
every
one
his
love
feat
will
advance
unto
his
several
mistress
which
they
ll
know
by
favours
several
which
they
did
bestow
princess
and
will
they
so
the
gallants
shall
be
task
d
for
ladies
we
shall
every
one
be
mask
d
and
not
a
man
of
them
shall
have
the
grace
despite
of
suit
to
see
a
lady
s
face
hold
rosaline
this
favour
thou
shalt
wear
and
then
the
king
will
court
thee
for
his
dear
hold
take
thou
this
my
sweet
and
give
me
thine
so
shall
biron
take
me
for
rosaline
and
change
your
favours
too
so
shall
your
loves
woo
contrary
deceived
by
these
removes
rosaline
come
on
then
wear
the
favours
most
in
sight
katharine
but
in
this
changing
what
is
your
intent
princess
the
effect
of
my
intent
is
to
cross
theirs
they
do
it
but
in
mocking
merriment
and
mock
for
mock
is
only
my
intent
their
several
counsels
they
unbosom
shall
to
loves
mistook
and
so
be
mock
d
withal
upon
the
next
occasion
that
we
meet
with
visages
displayed
to
talk
and
greet
rosaline
but
shall
we
dance
if
they
desire
to
t
princess
no
to
the
death
we
will
not
move
a
foot
nor
to
their
penn
d
speech
render
we
no
grace
but
while
tis
spoke
each
turn

why
that
contempt
will
kill
the
speaker

quite
divorce

my

it

i
swear
we
have
had
pastimes
here

left

but
of
late
ferdinand
how
madam

we

indeed
confronted
were
with

here
they
stay

an
hour

talk
d
apace
and
in
that
hour
my
lord
they
did
not
bless
us
with
one
happy
word
i
dare
not
call
them
fools
but
this
i
think
when
they
are
thirsty
fools
would
fain
have
drink
biron
this
jest
is
dry
to
me
fair
gentle
sweet
your
wit
makes
wise
things
foolish
when
we
greet
with
eyes
best
seeing
heaven
s
fiery
eye
by
light
we
lose
light
your
capacity
is
of
that
nature
that
to
your
huge
store
wise
things
seem
foolish
and
rich
things
but
poor
rosaline
this
proves
you
wise
and
rich
for
in
my
eye
biron
i
am
a
fool
and
full
of
poverty
rosaline
but
that
you
take
what
doth
to
you
belong
it
were
a
fault
to
snatch
words
from
my
tongue
biron
o
i
am
yours
and
all
that
i
possess
rosaline
all
the
fool
mine

vizard
that
superfluous

that

mock
us
now

not
arbitrate

though
the
mourning

of

forbid
the

the
holy

which
fain
it
would

was
first
on

not
the

justle
it

what
it

us
fashioning
our

even
to
the
opposed

our

what
in

hath
seem

is
full
of
unbefitting
strains
all
wanton
as
a

skipping
and
vain
form
d
by
the
eye
and
therefore
like
the
eye
full
of
strange
shapes
of
habits
and
of
forms
varying
in
subjects
as
the
eye
doth
roll
to
every
varied
object
in
his
glance
which
parti
coated
presence
of
loose
love
put
on
by

in
your
heavenly
eyes
have
misbecomed
our

those
heavenly
eyes
that
look
into

faults
suggested
us
to
make
therefore
ladies
our

being
yours
the
error
that
love
makes
is
likewise
yours
we
to
ourselves
prove
false
by
being
once
false
for
ever
to
be
true
to
those
that
make
us
both

and
even
that
falsehood
in
itself
a
sin

itself

turns

we
have
received
your

full
of

your
favours
the
ambassadors
of

in
our
maiden
council
rated
them
at

pleasant
jest
and
courtesy
as
bombast
and
as
lining
to
the
time
but
more
devout
than
this
in
our
respects
have
we
not
been
and
therefore
met
your

in
their
own
fashion
like
a
merriment

show
d
much
more
than

did
our

did
not
quote
them
so
ferdinand
now
at
the
latest
minute
of
the
hour
grant
us
your
loves
princess
a
time
methinks
too
short
to
make
a
world
without
end
bargain
in
no
no
my
lord
your
grace
is
perjured
much
full
of
dear
guiltiness
and
therefore
this
if
for
my
love
as
there
is
no
such
cause
you
will
do
aught
this
shall
you
do
for
me
your
oath
i
will
not
trust
but
go
with
speed
to
some
forlorn
and
naked
hermitage
remote
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
there
stay
until
the
twelve
celestial
signs
have
brought
about
the
annual
reckoning
if
this
austere
insociable
life
change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
if
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love

that
it
bear
this
trial
and
last
love
then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
come
challenge
me
challenge
me
by
these
deserts
and
by
this
virgin
palm
now
kissing
thine

will
be
thine
and
till
that
instant
shut
my
woeful
self
up
in
a
mourning
house
raining
the
tears
of
lamentation
for
the
remembrance
of
