grief

pithless
arms
like
to
a
wither
d
vine

among
which
terms
he
used
his

did
upbraid
me
with
my

obloquy
set
bars
before
my

the
percies
of

finding
his
usurpation
most
unjust
endeavor
d
my
advancement
to
the
throne
the
reason
moved
these
warlike
lords
to
this
was
for
that
young
king
richard
thus
removed
leaving
no

in
this
haughty

they
laboured
to
plant
the

they
their

long
after

when
henry

done
because
unworthily
thou
wast
installed
in

pardon
me
princely
henry

the

this
dastard
at

in

i
was
six
thousand
strong

that

were
almost
ten

before
we
met

that
a
stroke
was
given
like
to
a

did
run
away
in

assault
we
lost
twelve
hundred
men
myself
and
divers
gentlemen
beside
were
there
surprised

then
judge
great
lords
if
i
have
done
amiss
or
whether
that
such
cowards
ought
to
wear
this
ornament
of
knighthood
yea
or
no
gloucester
to
say
the
truth
this
fact
was
infamous
and
ill
beseeming
any
common
man
much
more
a
knight
a
captain
and
a
leader
talbot
when
first
this
order
was
ordain
d
my
lords
knights
of
the
garter
were
of
noble
birth
valiant
and
virtuous
full
of
haughty
courage
such
as
were
grown
to
credit
by
the
wars
not
fearing
death
nor
shrinking
for
distress
but
always
resolute
in
most
extremes
he
then
that
is
not
furnish
d
in
this
sort
doth
but
usurp
the
sacred
name
of
knight
profaning
this
most
honourable
order
and
should
if
i
were
worthy
to
be
judge
be
quite
degraded

to
boast
of

my

what

his
grace
that
he
hath
changed
his
style
no
more
but
plain
and
bluntly
to
the
king
hath
he
forgot
he
is
his
sovereign
or
doth
this
churlish
superscription
pretend
some
alteration
in
good

what

here
reads
i
have
upon

cause
moved
with
compassion
of
my

your
pernicious

monstrous

this

so
that
in

found
such
false
dissembling
guile

what
doth
my

doth
my

the
worst

this
fellow
here
with
envious
carping

upbraided
me
about
the
rose
i
wear
saying
the
sanguine
colour
of
the
leaves
did
represent
my
master
s
blushing
cheeks
when
stubbornly
he
did
repugn
the
truth
about
a
certain
question
in
the
law
argued
betwixt
the
duke
of
york
and
him
with
other
vile
and
ignominious
terms
in
confutation
of
which
rude
reproach
and
in
defence
of
my
lord

worthiness
i
crave
the
benefit
of
law
of

vernon
and
that
is
my
petition
noble
lord
for
though
he
seem
with
forged
quaint
conceit
to
set
a
gloss
upon
his
bold
intent
yet
know
my
lord
i
was
provoked
by
him
and
he
first
took
exceptions
at
this
badge
pronouncing
that
the
paleness
of
this
flower
bewray
d
the
faintness
of
my
master

york
will
not
this
malice
somerset
be
left
somerset
your

grudge
my
lord
of

will
out
though
ne
er
so
cunningly
you
smother
it
king
henry
vi
good
lord
what
madness
rules
in
brainsick
men
when
for
so
slight
and
frivolous
a
cause
such
factious
emulations
shall
arise
good
cousins
both
of
york
and
somerset
quiet
yourselves
i
pray
and
be
at
peace
york
let
this
dissension
first
be
tried
by
fight
and
then
your
highness
shall
command
a
peace
somerset
the
quarrel
toucheth
none
but
us
alone
betwixt
ourselves
let
us
decide
it
then
york
there
is
my
pledge
accept
it
somerset
vernon
nay
let
it
rest
where
it
began
at
first
basset
confirm
it
so
mine
honourable
lord
gloucester
confirm
it
so
confounded
be
your
strife
and
perish
ye
with
your
audacious
prate
presumptuous
vassals
are
you
not
ashamed
with
this
immodest
clamorous
outrage
to
trouble
and
disturb
the
king
and
us
and
you
my
lords
methinks
you
do
not
well
to
bear
with
their
perverse
objections
much
less
to
take
occasion
from
their
mouths
to
raise
a
mutiny
betwixt
yourselves
let
me
persuade
you
take
a
better
course
exeter
it
grieves
his
highness
good
my
lords
be
friends
king
henry
vi
come
hither
you
that
would
be
combatants
henceforth
i
charge
you
as
you
love
our
favour
quite
to
forget
this
quarrel
and
the
cause
and
you
my
lords
remember
where
we
are
in
france
amongst
a
fickle
wavering
nation
if
they
perceive
dissension
in
our
looks
and
that
within
ourselves
we
disagree
how
will
their
grudging
stomachs
be
provoked
to
wilful
disobedience
and
rebel
beside
what
infamy
will
there
arise
when
foreign
princes
shall
be
certified
that
for
a
toy
a
thing
of
no
regard
king
henry
s
peers
and
chief
nobility
destroy
d
themselves
and
lost
the
realm
of
france
o
think
upon
the
conquest
of
my
father
my
tender
years
and
let
us
not
forego
that
for
a
trifle
that
was
bought
with
blood
let
me
be
umpire
in
this
doubtful
strife
i
see
no
reason
if
i
wear
this
rose
putting
on
a
red
rose
that
any
one
should
therefore
be
suspicious
i
more
incline
to
somerset
than
york
both
are
my
kinsmen
and
i
love
them
both
as
well
they
may
upbraid
me
with
my
crown
because
forsooth
the
king
of
scots
is
crown
d
but
your
discretions
better
can
persuade
than
i
am
able
to
instruct
or
teach
and
therefore
as
we
hither
came
in
peace
so
let
us
still
continue
peace
and
love
cousin
of
york
we
institute
your
grace
to
be
our
regent
in
these
parts
of
france
and
good
my
lord
of
somerset
unite
your
troops
of
horsemen
with
his
bands
of
foot
and
like
true
subjects
sons
of
your
progenitors
go
cheerfully
together
and
digest
your
angry
choler
on
your
enemies
ourself
my
lord
protector
and
the
rest
after
some
respite
will
return
to
calais
from
thence
to
england
where
i
hope
ere
long
to
be
presented
by
your
victories
with
charles
alencon
and
that
traitorous
rout
flourish
exeunt
all
but
york
warwick
exeter
and
vernon
warwick
my
lord
of
york
i
promise
you
the
king
prettily
methought
did
play
the
orator
york
and
so
he
did
but
yet
i
like
it
not
in
that
he
wears
the
badge
of
somerset
warwick
tush
that
was
but
his
fancy
blame
him
not
i
dare
presume
sweet
prince
he
thought
no
harm
york
an
if
i
wist
he
did
but
let
it
rest
other
affairs
must
now
be
managed
exeunt
all
but
exeter
exeter
well
didst
thou
richard
to
suppress
thy
voice
for
had
the
passions
of
thy

burst
out
i

we
should
have
seen
decipher
d
there
more
rancorous
spite
more
furious
raging
broils
than
yet
can
be
imagined
or
supposed
but
howsoe

no

man
that
sees
this
jarring
discord
of
nobility
this
shouldering
of
each
other
in
the
court
this
factious
bandying
of
their
favourites
but
that
it
doth
presage
some
ill
event
tis
much
when

you

ruthless
slaughters
as

therefore
take

and
exeter
king
henry
vi
your
wondrous
rare
description
noble
earl
of
beauteous
margaret
hath
astonish
d
me
her
virtues
graced
with
external
gifts
do
breed
love
s
settled
passions
in
my
heart
and
like
as
rigor
of
tempestuous
gusts
provokes
the
mightiest
hulk
against
the
tide
so
am
i
driven
by
breath
of
her
renown
either
to
suffer
shipwreck
or
arrive
where
i
may
have
fruition
of
her
love
suffolk
tush
my
good
lord
this
superficial
tale
is
but
a
preface
of
her
worthy
praise
the
chief
perfections
of
that
lovely
dame
had
i
sufficient
skill
to
utter
them
would
make
a
volume
of
enticing
lines
able
to
ravish
any
dull
conceit
and
which
is
more
she
is
not
so
divine
so
full
replete
with
choice
of
all
delights
but
with
as
humble
lowliness
of
mind
she
is
content
to
be
at
your
command
command
i
mean
of
virtuous
chaste
intents
to
love
and
honour
henry
as
her
lord
king
henry
vi
and
otherwise
will
henry
ne
er
presume
therefore
my
lord
protector
give
consent
that
margaret
may
be
england
s
royal
queen
gloucester
so
should
i
give
consent
to
flatter
sin
you
know
my
lord
your
highness
is
betroth
d
unto
another
lady
of
esteem
how
shall
we
then
dispense
with
that
contract
and
not
deface
your
honour
with
reproach
suffolk
as
doth
a
ruler
with
unlawful
oaths
or
one
that
at
a
triumph
having
vow
d
to
try
his
strength
forsaketh
yet
the
lists
by
reason
of
his
adversary
s
odds
a
poor
earl
s
daughter
is
unequal
odds
and
therefore
may
be
broke
without
offence
gloucester
why
what
i
pray
is
margaret
more
than
that
her
father
is
no
better
than
an
earl
although
in
glorious
titles
he
excel
suffolk
yes
lord
her
father
is
a
king
the
king
of
naples
and
jerusalem
and
of
such
great
authority
in
france
as
his
alliance
will
confirm
our
peace
and
keep
the
frenchmen
in
allegiance
gloucester
and
so
the
earl
of
armagnac
may
do
because
he
is
near
kinsman
unto
charles
exeter
beside
his
wealth
doth
warrant
a
liberal
dower
where
reignier
sooner
will
receive
than
give
suffolk
a
dower
my
lords
disgrace
not
so
your
king
that
he
should
be
so
abject
base
and
poor
to
choose
for
wealth
and
not
for
perfect
love
henry
is
able
to
enrich
his
queen
and
not
seek
a
queen
to
make
him
rich
so
worthless
peasants
bargain
for
their
wives
as
market
men
for
oxen
sheep
or
horse
marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
than
to
be
dealt
in
by
attorneyship
not
whom
we
will
but
whom
his
grace
affects
must
be
companion
of
his
nuptial
bed
and
therefore
lords
since
he
affects
her
most
it
most
of
all
these
reasons
bindeth
us
in
our
opinions
she
should
be
preferr
d
for
what
is
wedlock
forced
but
a
hell
an
age
of
discord
and
continual
strife
whereas
the
contrary
bringeth
bliss
and
is
a
pattern
of
celestial
peace
whom
should
we
match
with
henry
being
a
king
but
margaret
that
is
daughter
to
a
king
her
peerless
feature
joined
with
her
birth
approves
her
fit
for
none
but
for
a
king
her
valiant
courage
and
undaunted
spirit
more
than
in
women
commonly
is
seen
will
answer
our
hope
in
issue
of
a
king
for
henry
son
unto
a
conqueror
is
likely
to
beget
more
conquerors
if
with
a
lady
of
so
high
resolve
as
is
fair
margaret
he
be
link
d
in
love
then
yield
my
lords
and
here
conclude
with
me
that
margaret
shall
be
queen
and
none
but
she
king
henry
vi
whether
it
be
through
force
of
your
report
my
noble
lord
of
suffolk
or
for
that
my
tender
youth
was
never
yet
attaint
with
any
passion
of
inflaming
love
i
cannot
tell
but
this
i
am
assured
i
feel
such
sharp
dissension
in
my
breast
such
fierce
alarums
both
of
hope
and
fear
as
i
am
sick
with
working
of
my
thoughts
take
therefore
shipping
post
my
lord
to
france
agree
to
any
covenants
and
procure
that
lady
margaret
do
vouchsafe
to
come
to
cross
the
seas
to
england
and
be
crown
d
king
henry
s
faithful
and
anointed
queen
for
your
expenses
and
sufficient
charge
among
the
people
gather
up
a
tenth
be
gone
i
say
for
till
you
do
return
i
rest
perplexed
with
a
thousand
cares
and
you
good
uncle
banish
all
offence
if
you
do
censure
me
by
what
you
were
not
what
you
are
i
know
it
will
excuse
this
sudden
execution
of
my
will
and
so
conduct
me
where
from
company
i
may
revolve
and
ruminate
my
grief
exit
gloucester
ay
grief
i
fear
me
both
at
first
and
last
exeunt
gloucester
and
exeter
suffolk
thus
suffolk
hath
prevail
d
and
thus
he
goes
as
did
the
youthful
paris
once
to
greece
with
hope
to
find
the
like
event
in
love
but
prosper
better
than
the
trojan
did
margaret
shall
now
be
queen
