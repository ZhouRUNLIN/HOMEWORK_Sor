the
life
of
king
henry
the
eighth
act
i
prologue
i
come
no
more
to
make
you
laugh
things
now
that
bear
a
weighty
and
a
serious
brow
sad
high
and
working
full
of
state
and
woe
such
noble
scenes
as
draw
the
eye
to
flow
we
now
present
those
that
can
pity
here
may
if
they
think
it
well
let
fall
a
tear
the
subject
will
deserve
it
such
as
give
their
money
out
of
hope
they
may
believe
may
here
find
truth
too
those
that
come
to
see
only
a
show
or
two
and
so
agree
the
play
may
pass
if
they
be
still
and
willing
i
ll
undertake
may
see
away
their
shilling
richly
in
two
short
hours
only
they
that
come
to
hear
a
merry
bawdy
play
a
noise
of
targets
or
to
see
a
fellow
in
a
long
motley
coat
guarded
with
yellow
will
be
deceived
for
gentle
hearers
know
to
rank
our
chosen
truth
with
such
a
show
as
fool
and
fight
is
beside
forfeiting
our
own
brains
and
the
opinion
that
we
bring
to
make
that
only
true
we
now
intend
will
leave
us
never
an
understanding
friend
therefore
for
goodness
sake
and
as
you
are
known
the
first
and
happiest
hearers
of
the
town
be
sad
as
we
would
make
ye
think
ye
see
the
very
persons
of
our
noble
story
as
they
were
living
think
you
see
them
great
and
follow
d
with
the
general
throng
and
sweat
of
thousand
friends
then
in
a
moment
see
how
soon
this
mightiness
meets
misery
and
if
you
can
be
merry
then
i
ll
say
a
man
may
weep
upon
his
wedding
day
scene
i
london
an
ante
chamber
in
the
palace
enter
norfolk
at
one
door
at
the
other
buckingham
and
abergavenny
buckingham
good
morrow
and
well
met
how
have
ye
done
since
last
we
saw
in
france
norfolk
i
thank
your
grace
healthful
and
ever
since
a
fresh
admirer
of
what
i
saw
there
buckingham
an
untimely
ague
stay
d
me
a
prisoner
in
my
chamber
when
those
suns
of
glory
those
two
lights
of
men
met
in
the
vale
of
andren
norfolk
twixt
guynes
and
arde
i
was
then
present
saw
them
salute
on
horseback
beheld
them
when
they
lighted
how
they
clung
in
their
embracement
as
they
grew
together
which
had
they
what
four
throned
ones
could
have
weigh
d
such
a
compounded
one
buckingham
all
the
whole
time
i
was
my
chamber
s
prisoner
norfolk
then
you
lost
the
view
of
earthly
glory
men
might
say
till
this
time
pomp
was
single
but
now
married
to
one
above
itself
each
following
day
became
the
next
day
s
master
till
the
last
made
former
wonders
its
to
day
the
french
all
clinquant
all
in
gold
like
heathen
gods
shone
down
the
english
and
to
morrow
they
made
britain
india
every
man
that
stood
show
d
like
a
mine
their
dwarfish
pages
were
as
cherubins
all
guilt
the
madams
too
not
used
to
toil
did
almost
sweat
to
bear
the
pride
upon
them
that
their
very
labour
was
to
them
as
a
painting
now
this
masque
was
cried
incomparable
and
the
ensuing
night
made
it
a
fool
and
beggar
the
two
kings
equal
in
lustre
were
now
best
now
worst
as
presence
did
present
them
him
in
eye
still
him
in
praise
and
being
present
both
twas
said
they
saw
but
one
and
no
discerner
durst
wag
his
tongue
in
censure
when
these
suns
for
so
they
phrase
em
by
their
heralds
challenged
the
noble
spirits
to
arms
they
did
perform
beyond
thought
s
compass
that
former
fabulous
story
being
now
seen
possible
enough
got
credit
that
bevis
was
believed
buckingham
o
you
go
far
norfolk
as
i
belong
to
worship
and
affect
in
honour
honesty
the
tract
of
every
thing
would
by
a
good
discourser
lose
some
life
which
action
s
self
was
tongue
to
all
was
royal
to
the
disposing
of
it
nought
rebell
d
order
gave
each
thing
view
the
office
did
distinctly
his
full
function
buckingham
who
did
guide
i
mean
who
set
the
body
and
the
limbs
of
this
great
sport
together
as
you
guess
norfolk
one
certes
that
promises
no
element
in
such
a
business
buckingham
i
pray
you
who
my
lord
norfolk
all
this
was
order
d
by
the
good
discretion
of
the
right
reverend
cardinal
of
york
buckingham
the
devil
speed
him
no
man
s
pie
is
freed
from
his
ambitious
finger
what
had
he
to
do
in
these
fierce
vanities
i
wonder
that
such
a
keech
can
with
his
very
bulk
take
up
the
rays
o
the
beneficial
sun
and
keep
it
from
the
earth
norfolk
surely
sir
there
s
in
him
stuff
that
puts
him
to
these
ends
for
being
not
propp
d
by
ancestry
whose
grace
chalks
successors
their
way
nor
call
d
upon
for
high
feats
done
to
the
crown
neither
allied
for
eminent
assistants
but
spider
like
out
of
his
self
drawing
web
he
gives
us
note
the
force
of
his
own
merit
makes
his
way
a
gift
that
heaven
gives
for
him
which
buys
a
place
next
to
the
king
abergavenny
i
cannot
tell
what
heaven
hath
given
him
let
some
graver
eye
pierce
into
that
but
i
can
see
his
pride
peep
through
each
part
of
him
whence
has
he
that
if
not
from
hell
the
devil
is
a
niggard
or
has
given
all
before
and
he
begins
a
new
hell
in
himself
buckingham
why
the
devil
upon
this
french
going
out
took
he
upon
him
without
the
privity
o
the
king
to
appoint
who
should
attend
on
him
he
makes
up
the
file
of
all
the
gentry
for
the
most
part
such
to
whom
as
great
a
charge
as
little
honour
he
meant
to
lay
upon
and
his
own
letter
the
honourable
board
of
council
out
must
fetch
him
in
the
papers
abergavenny
i
do
know
kinsmen
of
mine
three
at
the
least
that
have
by
this
so
sickened
their
estates
that
never
they
shall
abound
as
formerly
buckingham
o
many
have
broke
their
backs
with
laying
manors
on
em
for
this
great
journey
what
did
this
vanity
but
minister
communication
of
a
most
poor
issue
norfolk
grievingly
i
think
the
peace
between
the
french
and
us
not
values
the
cost
that
did
conclude
it
buckingham
every
man
after
the
hideous
storm
that
follow
d
was
a
thing
inspired
and
not
consulting
broke
into
a
general
prophecy
that
this
tempest
dashing
the
garment
of
this
peace
aboded
the
sudden
breach
on
t
norfolk
which
is
budded
out
for
france
hath
flaw
d
the
league
and
hath
attach
d
our
merchants
goods
at
bourdeaux
abergavenny
is
it
therefore
the
ambassador
is
silenced
norfolk
marry
is
t
abergavenny
a
proper
title
of
a
peace
and
purchased
at
a
superfluous
rate
buckingham
why
all
this
business
our
reverend
cardinal
carried
norfolk
like
it
your
grace
the
state
takes
notice
of
the
private
difference
betwixt
you
and
the
cardinal
i
advise
you
and
take
it
from
a
heart
that
wishes
towards
you
honour
and
plenteous
safety
that
you
read
the
cardinal
s
malice
and
his
potency
together
to
consider
further
that
what
his
high
hatred
would
effect
wants
not
a
minister
in
his
power
you
know
his
nature
that
he
s
revengeful
and
i
know
his
sword
hath
a
sharp
edge
it
s
long
and
t
may
be
said
it
reaches
far
and
where
twill
not
extend
thither
he
darts
it
bosom
up
my
counsel
you
ll
find
it
wholesome
lo
where
comes

rock

shunning

buckingham
sir
i
am
thankful
to
you
and
i
ll
go
along
by
your
prescription
but
this
top
proud
fellow
whom
from
the
flow
of
gall
i
name
not
but
from
sincere
motions
by
intelligence
and
proofs
as
clear
as
founts
in
july
when
we
see
each
grain
of
gravel
i
do
know
to
be
corrupt
and
treasonous
norfolk
say
not
treasonous
buckingham
to
the
king
i
ll
say
t
and
make
my
vouch
as
strong
as
shore
of
rock
attend
this
holy
fox
or
wolf
or
both
for
he
is
equal
ravenous
as
he
is
subtle
and
as
prone
to
mischief
as
able
to
perform
t
his
mind
and
place
infecting
one
another
yea
reciprocally
only
to
show
his
pomp
as
well
in
france
as
here
at
home
suggests
the
king
our
master
to
this
last
costly
treaty
the
interview
that
swallow
d
so
much
treasure
and
like
a
glass
did
break
i
the
rinsing
norfolk
faith
and
so
it
did
buckingham
pray
give
me
favour
sir
this
cunning
cardinal
the
articles
o
the
combination
drew
as
himself
pleased
and
they
were
ratified
as
he
cried
thus
let
be
to
as
much
end
as
give
a
crutch
to
the
dead
but
our
count
cardinal
has
done
this
and
tis
well
for
worthy
wolsey
who
cannot
err
he
did
it
now
this
follows
which
as
i
take
it
is
a
kind
of
puppy
to
the
old
dam
treason
charles
the
emperor
under
pretence
to
see
the
queen
his
aunt
for
twas
indeed
his
colour
but
he
came
to
whisper
wolsey
here
makes
visitation
his
fears
were
that
the
interview
betwixt
england
and
france
might
through
their
amity
breed
him
some
prejudice
for
from
this
league
peep
d
harms
that
menaced
him
he
privily
deals
with
our
cardinal
and
as
i
trow
which
i
do
well
for
i
am
sure
the
emperor
paid
ere
he
promised
whereby
his
suit
was
granted
ere
it
was
ask
d
but
when
the
way
was
made
and
paved
with
gold
the
emperor
thus
desired
that
he
would
please
to
alter
the
king
s
course
and
break
the
foresaid
peace
let
the
king
know
as
soon
he
shall
by
me
that
thus
the
cardinal
does
buy
and
sell
his
honour
as
he
pleases

for
his
own
advantage

thou
heard

surveyor
he
was
brought
to
this
by
a
vain
prophecy
of
nicholas
hopkins
king
henry

what
was
that
hopkins
surveyor
sir
a
chartreux
friar
his
confessor
who
fed
him
every

with
words
of

king
henry

how
know
st
thou
this

not
long
before

sped

the

at

rose
within
the
parish
saint
lawrence
poultney
did
of
me
demand
what
was
the
speech
among
the
londoners
concerning
the
french
journey
i
replied
men
fear
d
the
french
would
prove
perfidious
to
the
king
s
danger
presently
the
duke
said
twas
the
fear
indeed
and
that
he
doubted
twould
prove
the
verity
of
certain
words
spoke
by
a
holy
monk
that
oft
says
he
hath
sent
to
me
wishing
me
to
permit
john
de
la
car
my
chaplain
a
choice
hour
to
hear
from
him
a
matter
of
some
moment
whom
after
under
the
confession
s
seal
he
solemnly
had
sworn
that
what
he
spoke
my
chaplain
to
no
creature
living
but
to
me
should
utter
with
demure
confidence
this
pausingly
ensued
neither
the
king
nor
s
heirs
tell
you
the

shall
prosper

him
strive

gain
the
love

deceived

that
twas
dangerous
for

on

so
far
until
it
forged
him

two
gentlemen
meeting
first

whither
away
so
fast
second
gentleman
o
god
save
ye
even
to
the
hall
to
hear
what
shall
become
of
the
great
duke
of
buckingham
first
gentleman
i
ll
save
you
that
labour
sir
all
s
now
done
but
the
ceremony
of
bringing
back
the
prisoner
second
gentleman
were
you
there
first
gentleman
yes
indeed
was
i
second
gentleman
pray
speak
what
has
happen
d
first
gentleman
you
may
guess
quickly
what
second
gentleman
is
he
found
guilty
first
gentleman
yes
truly
is
he
and
condemn
d
upon
t
second
gentleman
i
am
sorry
for
t
first
gentleman
so
are
a
number
more
second
gentleman
but
pray
how
pass
d
it
first
gentleman
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
little
the
great
duke
came
to
the
bar
where
to
his
accusations
he
pleaded
still
not
guilty
and
alleged
many
sharp
reasons
to
defeat
the
law
the
king
s
attorney
on
the
contrary
urged
on
the
examinations
proofs
confessions
of
divers
witnesses
which
the
duke
desired
to
have
brought
viva
voce
to
his
face
at
which
appear
d
against
him
his
surveyor
sir
gilbert
peck
his
chancellor
and
john
car
confessor
to
him
with
that
devil
monk
hopkins
that
made
this
mischief
second
gentleman
that
was
he
that
fed
him
with
his
prophecies
first
gentleman
the
same
all
these
accused
him
strongly
which
he
fain
would
have
flung
from
him
but
indeed
he
could
not
and
so
his
peers
upon
this
evidence
have
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
much
he
spoke
and
learnedly
for
life
but
all
was
either
pitied
in
him
or
forgotten
second
gentleman
after
all
this
how
did
he
bear
himself
first
gentleman
when
he
was
brought
again
to
the
bar
to
hear
his
knell
rung
out
his
judgment
he
was
stirr
d
with
such
an
agony
he
sweat
extremely
and
something
spoke
in
choler
ill
and
hasty
but
he
fell
to
himself
again
and
sweetly
in
all
the
rest
show
d
a
most
noble
patience
second
gentleman
i
do
not
think
he
fears
death
first
gentleman
sure
he
does
not
he
never
was
so
womanish
the
cause
he
may
a
little
grieve
at
second
gentleman
certainly
the
cardinal
is
the
end
of
this
first
gentleman
tis
likely
by
all
conjectures
first
kildare
s
attainder
then
deputy
of
ireland
who
removed
earl
surrey
was
sent
thither
and
in
haste
too
lest
he
should
help
his
father
second
gentleman
that
trick
of
state
was
a
deep
envious
one
first
gentleman
at
his
return
no
doubt
he
will
requite
it
this
is
noted
and
generally
whoever
the
king
favours
the
cardinal
instantly
will
find
employment
and
far
enough
from
court
too
second
gentleman
all
the
commons
hate
him
perniciously
and
o
my
conscience
wish
him
ten
fathom
deep
this
duke
as
much
they
love
and
dote
on
call
him
bounteous
buckingham

when
i
came
hither

was
lord
high
constable
and
duke
of
buckingham
now
poor
edward
bohun
yet
i
am
richer
than
my
base
accusers
that
never
knew
what
truth
meant
i
now
seal
it
and
with
that
blood
will
make
em
one
day
groan
for
t
my
noble
father
henry
of
buckingham
who
first
raised
head
against
usurping
richard
flying
for
succor
to
his
servant

by
that
wretch

and
without
trial

peace

henry

seventh
succeeding
truly
pitying
my
father
s
loss
like
a
most
royal
prince
restored
me
to
my
honours
and
out
of
ruins
made
my
name
once
more
noble
now
his
son
henry
the
eighth
life
honour
name
and
all
that
made
me
happy
at
one
stroke
has
taken
for
ever
from
the
world
i
had
my
trial
and
must
needs
say
a
noble
one
which
makes
me
a
little
happier
than
my
wretched
father
yet
thus
far
we
are
one
in
fortunes
both
fell
by
our
servants
by
those
men
we
loved
most
a
most
unnatural
and
faithless
service
heaven
has
an
end
in
all
yet
you
that
hear
me
this
from
a
dying
man
receive
as
certain
where
you
are
liberal
of
your
loves
and
counsels
be
sure
you
be
not
loose
for
those
you
make
friends
and
give
your
hearts
to
when
they
once
perceive
the
least
rub
in
your
fortunes
fall
away
like
water
from
ye
never
found
again
but
where
they
mean
to
sink
ye
all
good
people
pray
for
me
i
must
now
forsake
ye
the
last
hour
of
my
long
weary
life
is
come
upon
me
farewell
and
when
you
would
say
something
that
is
sad
speak
how
i
fell
i
have
done
and
god
forgive
me
exeunt
buckingham
and
train
first
gentleman
o
this
is
full
of
pity
sir
it
calls
i
fear
too
many
curses
on
their
beads
that
were
the
authors
second
gentleman
if
the
duke
be
guiltless
tis
full
of
woe
yet
i
can
give
you
inkling
of
an
ensuing
evil
if
it
fall
greater
than
this
first
gentleman
good
angels
keep
it
from
us
what
may
it
be
you
do
not
doubt
my
faith
sir
second
gentleman
this
secret
is
so
weighty
twill
require
a
strong
faith
to
conceal
it
first
gentleman
let
me
have
it
i
do
not
talk
much
second
gentleman
i
am
confident
you
shall
sir
did
you
not
of
late
days
hear
a
buzzing
of
a
separation
between
the
king
and
katharine
first
gentleman
yes
but
it
held
not
for
when
the
king
once
heard
it
out
of
anger
he
sent
command
to
the
lord
mayor
straight
to
stop
the
rumor
and
allay
those
tongues
that
durst
disperse
it
second
gentleman
but
that
slander
sir
is
found
a
truth
now
for
it
grows
again
fresher
than
e
er
it
was
and
held
for
certain
the
king
will
venture
at
it
either
the
cardinal
or
some
about
him
near
have
out
of
malice
to
the
good
queen
possess
d
him
with
a
scruple
that
will
undo
her
to
confirm
this
too
cardinal
campeius
is
arrived
and
lately
as
all
think
for
this
business
first
gentleman
tis
the
cardinal
and
merely
to
revenge
him
on
the
emperor
for
not
bestowing
on
him
at
his
asking
the
archbishopric
of
toledo
this
is
purposed
second
gentleman
i
think
you
have
hit
the
mark
but
is
t
not
cruel
that
she
should
feel
the
smart
of
this
the
cardinal
will
have
his
will
and
she
must
fall
first
gentleman
tis
woful
we
are
too
open
here
to
argue
this
let
s
think
in
private
more
exeunt
scene
ii
an
ante
chamber
in
the
palace
enter
chamberlain
reading
a
letter
chamberlain
my
lord

sent
for
with
all
the
care
i
had
i
saw
well
chosen
ridden
and
furnished
they
were
young
and
handsome
and
of
the
best
breed
in
the
north
when
they
were
ready
to
set
out
for
london
a
man
of
my
lord
cardinal
s
by
commission
and
main
power
took
em
from
me
with
this
reason
his
master
would
be
served
before
a
subject
if
not
before
the
king
which
stopped
our
mouths
sir
i
fear
he
will
indeed
well
let
him
have
them
he
will
have
all
i
think
enter
to
chamberlain
norfolk
and
suffolk

my
lord
chamberlain

day
to
both
your
graces

chamberlain
i
left
him
private
full
of
sad
thoughts
and
troubles
norfolk
what
s
the
cause
chamberlain
it
seems
the
marriage
with
his
brother
s
wife
has
crept
too
near
his
conscience
suffolk
no
his
conscience
has
crept
too
near
another
lady
norfolk
tis
so
this
is
the
cardinal
s
doing
the
king
cardinal
that
blind
priest
like
the
eldest
son
of
fortune
turns
what
he
list
the
king
will
know
him
one
day
suffolk
pray
god
he
do
he
ll
never
know
himself
else
norfolk
how
holily
he
works
in
all
his
business
and
with
what
zeal
for
now
he
has
crack
d
the
league
between
us
and
the
emperor
the
queen
s
great
nephew
he
dives
into
the
king
s
soul
and
there
scatters
dangers
doubts
wringing
of
the
conscience
fears
and
despairs
and
all
these
for
his
marriage
and
out
of
all
these
to
restore
the
king
he
counsels
a
divorce
a
loss
of
her
that
like
a
jewel
has
hung
twenty
years
about
his
neck
yet
never
lost
her
lustre
of
her
that
loves
him
with
that
excellence
that
angels
love
good
men
with
even
of
her
that
when
the
greatest
stroke
of
fortune
falls
will
bless
the
king
and
is
not
this
course
pious
chamberlain
heaven

me
from
such
counsel

most
true

assembled

your
cause

shall
be
therefore
bootless

you
desire
the
court
as
well
for
your
own
quiet
as
to
rectify
what
is
unsettled
in
the
king
cardinal
campeius
his
grace
hath
spoken
well
and
justly
therefore
madam
it
s
fit

royal
session

and
that
without
delay
their
arguments
be
now
produced
and
heard

katharine
lord
cardinal
to
you
i
speak
cardinal
wolsey
your
pleasure
madam
queen
katharine
sir
i
am
about
to
weep
but
thinking
that
we
are
a
queen
or
long
have
dream
d
so
certain
the
daughter
of
a
king
my
drops
of
tears
i
ll
turn
to
sparks
of
fire
cardinal
wolsey
be
patient
yet
queen
katharine
i
will
when
you
are
humble
nay
before
or
god
will
punish
me
i
do
believe
induced
by
potent
circumstances
that
you
are
mine
enemy
and
make
my
challenge
you
shall
not
be
my
judge
for
it
is
you
have
blown
this
coal
betwixt
my
lord
and
me
which
god
s
dew
quench
therefore
i
say
again
i
utterly
abhor
yea
from
my
soul
refuse
you
for
my
judge
whom
yet
once
more
i
hold
my
most
malicious
foe
and
think
not
at
all
a
friend
to
truth
cardinal
wolsey
i
do
profess
you
speak
not
like
yourself
who
ever
yet
have
stood
to
charity
and
display
d
the
effects
of
disposition
gentle
and
of
wisdom
o
ertopping
woman
s
power
madam
you
do
me
wrong
i
have
no
spleen
against
you
nor
injustice
for
you
or
any
how
far
i
have
proceeded
or
how
far
further
shall
is
warranted
by
a
commission
from
the
consistory
yea
the
whole
consistory
of
rome
you
charge
me
that
i
have
blown
this
coal
i
do
deny
it
the
king
is
present
if
it
be
known
to
him
that
i
gainsay
my
deed
how
may
he
wound
and
worthily
my
falsehood
yea
as
much
as
you
have
done
my
truth
if
he
know
that
i
am
free
of
your
report
he
knows
i
am
not
of
your
wrong
therefore
in
him
it
lies
to
cure
me
and
the
cure
is
to
remove
these
thoughts
from
you
the
which
before
his
highness
shall
speak
in
i
do
beseech
you
gracious
madam
to
unthink
your
speaking
and
to
say
so
no
more
queen
katharine

lord

a
simple

your
place
and

and
pride

fortune
and
his
highness
favours
gone
slightly
o
er
low
steps

you
serve
your
will
as
t
please
yourself
pronounce
their
office
i
must
tell

for

be
unloosed

at
once
and
fully
satisfied
whether
ever
i
did
broach
this
business
to
your
highness
or
laid
any
scruple
in
your
way
which
might
induce
you
to
the
question
on
t
or
ever
have
to
you
but
with
thanks
to
god
for
such
a
royal
lady
spake
one
the
least
word
that
might
be
to
the
prejudice
of
her
present
state
or
touch
of
her
good
person
king
henry
viii
my
lord
cardinal
i
do
excuse
you
yea
upon
mine
honour
i
free
you
from
t
you
are
not
to
be
taught
that
you
have
many
enemies
that
know
not
why
they
are
so
but
like
to
village
curs
bark
when
their
fellows
do
by
some
of
these
the
queen
is
put
in
anger
you
re
excused
but
will
you
be
more
justified
you
ever
have
wish
d
the
sleeping
of
this
business
never
desired
it
to
be
stirr
d
but
oft
have
hinder
d
oft
the
passages
made
toward
it
on
my
honour
i
speak
my
good
lord
cardinal
to
this
point
and
thus
far
clear
him
now
what
moved
me
to
t
i
will
be
bold
with
time
and
your
attention
then
mark
the
inducement
thus
it
came
give
heed
to
t
my
conscience
first
received
a
tenderness
scruple
and
prick
on
certain
speeches
utter
d
by
the
bishop
of
bayonne
then
french
ambassador
who
had
been
hither
sent
on
the
debating
a
marriage
twixt
the
duke
of
orleans
and
our
daughter
mary
i
the
progress
of
this
business
ere
a
determinate
resolution
he
i
mean
the
bishop
did
require
a
respite
wherein
he
might
the
king
his
lord
advertise
whether
our
daughter
were
legitimate
respecting
this
our
marriage
with
the
dowager
sometimes
our
brother
s
wife
this
respite
shook
the
bosom
of
my
conscience
enter
d
me
yea
with
a
splitting
power
and
made
to
tremble
the
region
of
my
breast
which
forced
such
way
that
many
mazed
considerings
did
throng
and
press
d
in
with
this
caution
first
methought
i
stood
not
in
the
smile
of
heaven
who
had
commanded
nature
that
my
lady
s
womb
if
it
conceived
a
male
child
by
me
should
do
no
more
offices
of
life
to
t
than
the
grave
does
to
the
dead
for
her
male
issue
or
died
where
they
were
made
or
shortly
after
this
world
had
air
d
them
hence
i
took
a
thought
this
was
a
judgment
on
me
that
my
kingdom
well
worthy
the
best
heir
o
the
world
should
not
be
gladded
in
t
by
me
then
follows
that
i
weigh
d
the
danger
which
my
realms
stood
in
by
this
my
issue
s
fail
and
that
gave
to
me
many
a
groaning
throe
thus
hulling
in
the
wild
sea
of
my
conscience
i
did
steer
toward
this
remedy
whereupon
we
are
now
present
here
together
that
s
to
say
i
meant
to
rectify
my
conscience
which
i
then
did
feel
full
sick
and
yet
not
well
by
all
the
reverend
fathers
of
the
land
and
doctors
learn
d
first
i
began
in
private
with
you
my
lord
of
lincoln
you
remember
how
under
my
oppression
i
did
reek
when
i
first
moved
you
lincoln
very
well
my
liege
king
henry
viii
i
have
spoke
long
be
pleased
yourself
to
say
how
far
you
satisfied
me
lincoln
so
please
your
highness
the
question
did
at
first
so
stagger
me
bearing
a
state
of
mighty
moment
in
t
and
consequence
of
dread
that
i
committed
the
daring
st
counsel
which
i
had
to
doubt
and
did
entreat
your
highness
to
this
course
which
you
are
running
here
king
henry
viii
i
then
moved
you
my
lord
of
canterbury
and
got
your
leave
to
make
this
present
summons
unsolicited
i
left
no
reverend
person
in
this
court
but
by
particular
consent
proceeded
under
your
hands
and
seals
therefore
go
on
for
no
dislike
i
the
world
against
the
person
of
the
good
queen
but
the
sharp
thorny
points
of
my
alleged
reasons
drive
this
forward
prove
but
our
marriage
lawful
by
my
life
and
kingly
dignity
we
are
contented
to
wear
our
mortal
state
to
come
with
her
katharine
our
queen
before
the
primest
creature
that
s
paragon
d
o
the
world
cardinal
campeius
so
please
your
highness
the
queen
being
absent
tis
a
needful
fitness
that
we
adjourn
this
court
till
further
day
meanwhile
must
be
an
earnest
motion
made
to
the
queen
to
call
back
her
appeal
she
intends
unto
his
holiness
king
henry
viii
[aside]
i
may
perceive
these
cardinals
trifle
with
me
i
abhor
this
dilatory
sloth
and
tricks
of

beloved

how
came

suffolk
most
strangely
surrey
o
how
how
suffolk
the
cardinal

letters
to

miscarried
and
came
to
the
eye
o
the

wherein
was
read
how
that
the

did
entreat
his
holiness
to
stay
the
judgment
o

for

this

lay
upon

i

is
most
false
the

found
his
deserts
how
innocent
i
was
from
any
private
malice
in

little
honesty
as
honour
that
in

hear
this
arrogance
and
from
this
fellow
if

live
thus
tamely
to
be
thus
jaded
by
a
piece
of
scarlet
farewell
nobility
let
his
grace
go
forward
and
dare
us
with
his
cap
like
larks
cardinal
wolsey
all
goodness
is
poison
to
thy
stomach
surrey
yes
that
goodness
of
gleaning
all
the
land
s
wealth
into
one
into
your
own
hands
cardinal
by
extortion
the
goodness
of
your
intercepted
packets
you
writ
to
the
pope
against
the
king
your
goodness
since
you
provoke
me
shall
be
most
notorious
my
lord
of
norfolk
as
you
are
truly
noble
as
you
respect
the
common
good
the
state
of
our
despised
nobility
our
issues
who
if
he
live
will
scarce
be
gentlemen
produce
the
grand
sum
of
his
sins
the
articles
collected
from
his
life
i
ll
startle
you
worse
than
the
scaring
bell
when
the
brown
wench
lay
kissing
in
your
arms
lord
cardinal
cardinal
wolsey
how
much
methinks
i
could
despise
this
man
but
that
i
am
bound
in
charity
against
it
norfolk
those
articles
my
lord
are
in
the
king
s
hand
but
thus
much
they
are
foul
ones
cardinal
wolsey
so
much
fairer
and
spotless
shall
mine
innocence
arise
when
the
king
knows
my
truth
surrey
this
cannot
save
you
i
thank
my
memory
i
yet
remember
some
of
these
articles
and
out
they
shall
now
if
you
can
blush
and
cry
guilty
cardinal
you
ll
show
a
little
honesty
cardinal
wolsey
speak
on
sir
i
dare
your
worst
objections
if
i
blush
it
is
to
see
a
nobleman
want
manners
surrey
i
had
rather
want
those
than
my
head
have
at
you
first
that
without
the
king
s
assent
or
knowledge
you
wrought
to
be
a
legate
by
which
power
you
maim
d
the
jurisdiction
of
all
bishops
norfolk
then
that
in
all
you
writ
to
rome
or
else
to
foreign
princes
ego
et
rex
meus
was
still
inscribed
in
which
you
brought
the
king
to
be
your
servant
suffolk
then
that
without
the
knowledge
either
of
king
or
council
when
you
went
ambassador
to
the
emperor
you
made
bold
to
carry
into
flanders
the
great
seal
surrey
item
you
sent
a
large
commission
to
gregory
de
cassado
to
conclude
without
the
king
s
will
or
the
state
s
allowance
a
league
between
his
highness
and
ferrara
suffolk
that
out
of
mere
ambition
you
have
caused
your
holy
hat
to
be
stamp
d
on
the
king
s
coin
surrey
then
that
you
have
sent
innumerable
substance
by
what
means
got
i
leave
to
your
own
conscience
to
furnish
rome
and
to
prepare
the
ways
you
have
for
dignities
to
the
mere
undoing
of
all
the
kingdom
many
more
there
are
which
since
they
are
of
you
and
odious
i
will
not
taint
my
mouth
with
chamberlain
o
my
lord
press
not
a
falling
man
too
far
tis
virtue
his
faults
lie
open
to
the
laws
let
them
not
you
correct
him
my
heart
weeps
to
see
him
so
little
of
his
great
self
surrey
i
forgive
him
suffolk
lord
cardinal
the
king
s
further
pleasure
is
because
all
those
things
you
have
done
of
late
by
your
power
legatine
within
this
kingdom
fall
into
the
compass
of
a
praemunire
that
therefore
such
a
writ
be
sued
against
you
to
forfeit
all
your
goods
lands
tenements
chattels
and
whatsoever
and
to
be
out
of
the
king
s
protection
this
is
my
charge
norfolk
and
so
we
ll
leave
you
to
your
meditations
how
to
live
better
for
your
stubborn
answer
about
the
giving
back
the
great
seal
to
us
the
king
shall
know
it
and
no
doubt
shall
thank
you
so
fare
you
well
my
little
good
lord
cardinal
exeunt
all
but
cardinal
wolsey
cardinal
wolsey
so
farewell
to
the
little
good
you
bear
me
farewell
a
long
farewell
to
all
my
greatness
this
is
the
state
of
man
to
day
he
puts
forth
the
tender
leaves
of
hopes
to
morrow
blossoms
and
bears
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
and
when
he
thinks
good
easy
man
full
surely
his
greatness
is
a
ripening
nips
his
root
and
then
he
falls
as
i
do
i
have
ventured
like
little
wanton
boys
that
swim
on
bladders
this
many
summers
in
a
sea
of
glory
but
far
beyond
my
depth
my
high
blown
pride
at
length
broke
under
me
and
now
has
left
me
weary
and
old
with
service
to
the
mercy
of
a
rude
stream
that
must
for
ever
hide
me
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
this
world
i
hate
ye
i
feel
my
heart
new
open
d
o
how
wretched
is
that
poor
man
that
hangs
on
princes
favours
there
is
betwixt
that
smile
we
would
aspire
to
that
sweet
aspect
of
princes
and
their
ruin
more
pangs
and
fears
than
wars
or
women
have
and
when
he
falls
he
falls
like
lucifer
never
to
hope
again
enter
cromwell
and
stands
amazed
why
how
now
cromwell
cromwell
i
have
no
power
to
speak
sir
cardinal
wolsey
what
amazed
at
my
misfortunes
can

great
man
should
decline

earthly
dignities

still
and
quiet
conscience

king
has
cured
me

humbly
thank
his
grace
and
from
these
shoulders
these

of
pity

load

right
use
of
it
cardinal

of
a
fortitude
of
soul

greater

than
my
weak
hearted
enemies

a
learned
man
may
he
continue
long
in
his
highness
favour
and
do
justice
for
truth
s
sake
and
his
conscience
that
his
bones
when
he
has
run
his
course
and
sleeps
in
blessings

a
tomb
of
orphans

old
noble
lady

is
and
all
the
rest
are
countesses

so
these
are
stars
indeed
and
sometimes
falling
ones
first

more
of
that
exit
procession
and
then
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
enter
a
third
gentleman
first
gentleman
god
save
you
sir
where
have
you
been
broiling
third
gentleman
among
the
crowd
i
the
abbey
where
a
finger
could
not
be
wedged
in
more
i
am
stifled
with
the
mere
rankness
of
their
joy
second
gentleman
you
saw
the
ceremony
third
gentleman
that

did

i
am
able
the
rich
stream
of
lords
and
ladies
having
brought
the
queen
to
a
prepared
place
in
the
choir
fell
off
a
distance
from
her
while
her
grace
sat
down
to
rest
awhile
some
half
an
hour
or
so
in
a
rich
chair
of
state
opposing
freely
the
beauty
of
her
person
to
the
people
believe
me
sir
she
is
the
goodliest
woman
that
ever
lay
by
man
which
when
the
people
had
the
full
view
of
such
a
noise
arose
as
the
shrouds
make
at
sea
in
a
stiff
tempest
as
loud
and
to
as
many
tunes
hats
cloaks
doublets
i
think
flew
up
and
had
their
faces
been
loose
this
day
they
had
been
lost
such
joy
i
never
saw
before
great
bellied
women
that
had
not
half
a
week
to
go
like
rams
in
the
old
time
of
war
would
shake
the
press
and
make
em
reel
before
em
no
man
living
could
say
this
is
my
wife
there
all
were
woven
so
strangely
in
one
piece
second
gentleman
but

length

and
with
modest
paces

like
cast
her
fair
eyes
to
heaven
and
pray
d
devoutly
then

all
the
royal
makings
of
a
queen
as
holy
oil
edward
confessor

nobly
on

which

d
the
choir
with
all
the
choicest
music
of

together
sung

exeunt
scene
ii
kimbolton
enter
katharine
dowager
sick
led
between
griffith
her
gentleman
usher
and
patience
her
woman
griffith
how
does
your
grace
katharine
o
griffith
sick
to
death
my
legs
like
loaden
branches
bow
to
the
earth
willing
to
leave
their
burthen
reach
a
chair
so
now
methinks
i
feel
a
little
ease
didst
thou
not
tell
me
griffith
as
thou
led
st
me
that
the
great
child
of
honour
cardinal
wolsey
was
dead
griffith
yes
madam
but
i
think
your
grace
out
of
the
pain
you
suffer
d
gave
no
ear
to
t
katharine
prithee
good
griffith
tell
me
how
he
died
if
well
he
stepp
d
before
me
happily
for
my
example
griffith
well
the
voice
goes
madam
for
after
the
stout
earl
northumberland
arrested
him
at
york
and
brought
him
forward
as
a
man
sorely
tainted
to
his
answer
he
fell
sick
suddenly
and
grew
so
ill
he
could
not
sit
his
mule
katharine
alas
poor
man
griffith
at
last
with
easy
roads
he
came
to
leicester
lodged
in
the
abbey
where
the
reverend
abbot
with
all
his
covent
honourably
received
him
to
whom
he
gave
these
words
o
father
abbot
an
old
man
broken
with
the
storms
of
state
is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
ye
give
him
a
little
earth
for
charity
so
went
to
bed
where
eagerly
his
sickness
pursued
him
still
and
three
nights
after
this
about
the
hour
of
eight
which
he
himself
foretold
should
be
his
last
full
of
repentance
continual
meditations
tears
and
sorrows
he
gave
his
honours
to
the
world
again
his
blessed
part
to
heaven
and
slept
in
peace
katharine
so
may
he
rest
his
faults
lie
gently
on
him
yet
thus
far
griffith
give
me
leave
to
speak
him
and
yet
with
charity
he
was
a
man
of
an
unbounded
stomach
ever
ranking
himself
with
princes
one
that
by
suggestion
tied
all
the
kingdom
simony
was
fair
play
his
own
opinion
was
his
law
i
the
presence
he
would
say
untruths
and
be
ever
double
both
in
his
words
and
meaning
he
was
never
but
where
he
meant
to
ruin
pitiful
his
promises
were
as
he
then
was
mighty
but
his
performance
as
he
is
now
nothing
of
his
own
body
he
was
ill
and
gave
the
clergy
in
example
griffith
noble
madam
men
s
evil
manners
live
in
brass
their
virtues
we
write
in
water
may
it
please
your
highness
to
hear
me
speak
his
good
now
katharine
yes
good
griffith
i
were
malicious
else
griffith
this
cardinal
though
from
an
humble
stock
undoubtedly
was
fashion
d
to
much
honour
from
his
cradle
he
was
a
scholar
and
a
ripe
and
good
one
exceeding
wise
fair
spoken
and
persuading
lofty
and
sour
to
them
that
loved
him
not
but
to
those
men
that
sought
him
sweet
as
summer
and
though
he
were
unsatisfied
in
getting
which
was
a
sin
yet
in
bestowing
madam
he
was
most
princely
ever
witness
for
him
those
twins
of
learning
that
he
raised
in
you
ipswich
and
oxford
one
of
which
fell
with
him
unwilling
to
outlive
the
good
that
did
it
the
other
though
unfinish
d
yet
so
famous
so
excellent
in
art
and
still
so
rising
that
christendom
shall
ever
speak
his
virtue
his
overthrow
heap
d
happiness
upon
him
for
then
and
not
till
then
he
felt
himself
and
found
the
blessedness
of
being
little
and
to
add
greater
honours
to
his
age
than
man
could
give
him
he
died
fearing
god
katharine
after
my
death
i
wish
no
other
herald
no
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
to
keep
mine
honour
from
corruption
but
such
an
honest
chronicler
as
griffith
whom
i
most
hated
living
thou
hast
made
me
with
thy
religious
truth
and
modesty
now
in
his
ashes

peace
be
with
him

not

six
personages
clad
in
white
robes
wearing
on
their
heads
garlands
of
bays
and
golden
vizards
on
their
faces
branches
of
bays
or
palm
in
their
hands
they
first
congee
unto
her
then
dance
and
at
certain
changes
the
first
two
hold
a
spare
garland
over
her
head
at
which
the
other
four
make
reverent
curtsies
then
the
two
that
held
the
garland
deliver
the
same
to
the
other
next
two
who
observe
the
same
order
in
their
changes
and
holding
the
garland
over
her
head
which
done
they
deliver
the
same
garland
to
the
last
two
who
likewise
observe
the
same
order
at
which
as
it
were
by
inspiration
she
makes
in
her
sleep
signs
of
rejoicing
and
holdeth
up
her
hands
to
heaven
and
so
in
their
dancing
vanish

the
garland

them

my

hitherto
in
all
the
progress
both
of
my

have
labour
d
and
with
no
little
study
that
my
teaching
and
the
strong
course
of
my
authority
might
go
one
way
and
safely
and
the
end
was
ever
to
do
well
nor
is
there
living
i
speak
it
with
a
single
heart
my
lords
a
man
that
more
detests
more
stirs
against
both
in
his
private
conscience
and
his
place
defacers
of
a
public
peace
than
i
do
pray
heaven
the
king
may
never
find
a
heart
with
less
allegiance
in
it
men
that
make
envy
and
crooked
malice
nourishment
dare
bite
the
best
i
do
beseech
your
lordships
that
in
this
case
of
justice
my
accusers
be
what
they
will
may
stand
forth
face
to
face
and
freely
urge
against
me
suffolk
nay
my
lord
that
cannot
be
you
are
a
counsellor
and
by
that
virtue
no
man
dare
accuse
you
gardiner

lord
because
we
have
business
of
more
moment

will
be
short
with
you

his

right
ring

told

all
when

dangerous
stone
a
rolling
twould
fall
upon
ourselves
norfolk
do
you
think
my
lords
the
king
will
suffer
but
the
little
finger
of
this
man
to
be
vex
d
chancellor
tis
now
too
certain
how
much
more
is
his
life
in
value
with
him
would
i
were
fairly
out
on
t
cromwell
my
mind
gave
me
in
seeking
tales
and
informations
against
this
man
whose
honesty
the
devil
and
his
disciples
only
envy
at
ye
blew
the
fire
that
burns
ye
now
have
at
ye
enter
king
frowning
on
them
takes
his
seat
gardiner
dread
sovereign
how
much
are
we
bound
to
heaven
in
daily
thanks
that
gave
us
such
a
prince
not
only
good
and
wise
but
most
religious
one
that
in
all
obedience
makes
the
church
the
chief
aim
of
his
honour
and
to
strengthen
that
holy
duty
out
of
dear
respect
his
royal
self
in
judgment
comes
to
hear
the
cause
betwixt
her
and
this
great
offender
king
henry
viii
you
were
ever
good
at
sudden
commendations
bishop
of
winchester
but
know
i
come
not
to
hear
such
flattery
now
and
in
my
presence
they
are
too
thin
and
bare
to
hide
offences
to
me
you
cannot
reach
you
play
the
spaniel
and
think
with
wagging
of
your
tongue
to
win
me
but
whatsoe
er
thou
takest
me
for
i
m
sure
thou
hast
a
cruel
nature
and
a
bloody
to
cranmer
good
man
sit
down
now
let
me
see
the
proudest
he
that
dares
most
but
wag
his
finger
at
thee
by
all
that
s
holy
he
had
better
starve
than
but
once
think
this
place
becomes
thee
not
surrey
may
it
please
your
grace
king
henry
viii
no
sir
it
does
not
please
me
i
had
thought
i
had
had
men
of
some
understanding
and
wisdom
of
my
council
but
i
find
none
was
it
discretion
lords
to
let
this
man
this
good
man
few
of
you
deserve
that
title
this
honest
man
wait
like
a
lousy
footboy
at
chamber
door
and
one
as
great
as
you
are
why
what
a
shame
was
this
did
my
commission
bid
ye
so
far
forget
yourselves
i
gave
ye
power
as
he
was
a
counsellor
to
try
him
not
as
a
groom
there
s
some
of
ye
i
see
more
out
of
malice
than
integrity
would
try
him
to
the
utmost
had
ye
mean
which
ye
shall
never
have
while
i
live
chancellor
thus
far
my
most
dread
sovereign
may
it
like
your
grace
to
let
my
tongue
excuse
all
what
was
purposed
concerning
his
imprisonment
was
rather
if
there
be
faith
in
men
meant
for
his
trial
and
fair
purgation
to
the
world
than
malice
i
m
sure
in
me
king
henry
viii
well
well
my
lords
respect
him
take
him
and
use
him
well
he
s
worthy
of
it
i
will
say
thus
much
for
him
if
a
prince
may
be
beholding
to
a
subject
i
am
for
his
love
and
service
so
to
him

me
no
more

there

a

somewhat
near

he
should
be
a
brazier
by
his
face
for
o
my
conscience
twenty
of
the
dog
days
now
reign
in

nose
all
that

about

are
under
the
line
they
need
no

penance

fire
drake
did
i
hit
three
times
on
the
head
and
three
times
was
his
nose
discharged
against

he
stands
there
like
a
mortar
piece
to
blow
us
there
was
a
haberdasher
s
wife
of
small
wit
near
him
that
railed
upon
me
till
her
pinked
porringer
fell
off
her
head
for
kindling
such
a
combustion
in

state
i
missed
the
meteor
once
and
hit
that
woman
who
cried
out
clubs
when
i
might
see
from

some
forty
truncheoners
draw
to
her
succor

were
the
hope
o

was
quartered

fell
on
i
made
good
my
place
at
length
they
came
to
the
broom
staff
to
me
i
defied
em
still
when
suddenly
a
file
of
boys
behind
em
loose
shot
delivered
such
a
shower
of
pebbles
that
i
was
fain
to
draw
mine
honour
in
and
let
em
win
the
work
the
devil
was
amongst

the
youths
that
thunder
at

for
bitten
apples
