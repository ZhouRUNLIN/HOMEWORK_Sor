they
would
bind
me
here
unto
the

me
to
this
miserable
death

let
me
say
that
never

are
now
prevailing
orators
lucius
o
noble
father
you
lament
in
vain
the
tribunes
hear
you
not
no
man
is
by
and
you
recount
your
sorrows
to
a
stone
titus
andronicus
ah
lucius
for
thy
brothers
let
me
plead
grave
tribunes
once
more
i
entreat
of
you
lucius
my
gracious
lord
no
tribune
hears
you
speak
titus
andronicus
why
tis
no
matter
man
if
they
did
hear
they
would
not
mark
me
or
if
they
did
mark
they
would
not
pity
me
yet
plead
i
must
therefore
i
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
stones
who
though
they
cannot
answer
my
distress
yet
in
some
sort
they
are
better
than
the
tribunes
for
that
they
will
not
intercept
my
tale
when
i
do
weep
they
humbly
at
my
feet
receive
my
tears
and
seem
to
weep
with
me
and
were
they
but
attired
in
grave
weeds
rome
could
afford
no
tribune
like
to
these
a
stone
is
soft
as
wax
tribunes
more
hard
than
stones
a
stone
is
silent
and
offendeth
not
and
tribunes
with
their
tongues
doom
men
to
death
rises
but
wherefore
stand
st
thou
with
thy
weapon
drawn
lucius
to
rescue
my
two
brothers
from
their
death
for
which
attempt
the
judges
have
pronounced
my
everlasting
doom
of
banishment
titus
andronicus
o
happy
man
they
have
befriended
thee
why
foolish
lucius
dost
thou
not
perceive
that
rome
is
but
a
wilderness
of
tigers
tigers
must
prey
and
rome
affords
no
prey
but
me
and
mine
how
happy
art
thou
then
from
these
devourers
to
be
banished
but
who
comes
with
our
brother
marcus
here
enter
marcus
and
lavinia
marcus
andronicus
titus
prepare
thy
aged
eyes
to
weep
or
if
not
so
thy
noble
heart
to
break
i
bring
consuming
sorrow
to
thine
age
titus
andronicus
will
it
consume
me
let
me
see
it
then
marcus
andronicus
this
was
thy
daughter
titus
andronicus
why
marcus
so
she
is
lucius
ay
me
this
object
kills
me
titus
andronicus
faint
hearted
boy
arise
and
look
upon
her
speak
lavinia
what
accursed
hand
hath
made
thee
handless
in
thy
father
s
sight
what
fool
hath
added
water
to
the
sea
or
brought
a
faggot
to
bright
burning
troy
my
grief
was
at
the
height
before
thou
camest
and
now
like
nilus
it
disdaineth
bounds
give
me
a
sword
i
ll
chop
off
my
hands
too
for
they
have
fought
for
rome
and
all
in
vain
and
they
have
nursed
this
woe
in
feeding
life
in
bootless
prayer
have
they
been
held
up
and
they
have
served
me
to
effectless
use
now
all
the
service
i
require
of
them
is
that
the
one
will
help
to
cut
the
other
tis
well
lavinia
that
thou
hast
no
hands
for
hands
to
do
rome
service
are
but
vain
lucius
speak
gentle
sister
who
hath
martyr
d
thee
marcus
andronicus
o
that
delightful
engine
of
her
thoughts
that
blabb
d
them
with
such
pleasing
eloquence
is
torn
from
forth
that
pretty
hollow
cage
where
like
a
sweet
melodious
bird
it
sung
sweet
varied
notes
enchanting
every
ear
lucius
o
say
thou
for
her
who
hath
done
this
deed
marcus
andronicus
o
thus
i
found
her
straying
in
the
park
seeking
to
hide
herself
as
doth
the
deer
that
hath
received
some
unrecuring
wound
titus
andronicus
it
was
my
deer
and
he
that
wounded
her
hath
hurt
me
more
than
had
he
killed
me
dead
for
now
i
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
environed
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave
expecting
ever
when
some
envious
surge
will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
this
way
to
death
my
wretched
sons
are
gone
here
stands
my
other
son
a
banished
man
and
here
my
brother
weeping
at
my
woes
but
that
which
gives
my
soul
the
greatest
spurn
is
dear
lavinia
dearer
than
my
soul
had
i
but
seen
thy
picture
in
this
plight
it
would
have
madded
me
what
shall
i
do
now
i
behold
thy
lively
body
so
thou
hast
no
hands
to
wipe
away
thy
tears
nor
tongue
to
tell
me
who
hath
martyr
d
thee
thy
husband
he
is
dead
and
for
his
death
thy
brothers
are
condemn
d
and
dead
by
this
look
marcus
ah
son
lucius
look
on
her
when
i
did
name
her
brothers
then
fresh
tears
stood
on
her
cheeks
as
doth
the
honey
dew
upon
a
gather
d
lily
almost
wither
d
marcus
andronicus
perchance
she
weeps
because
they
kill
d
her
husband
perchance
because
she
knows
them
innocent
titus
andronicus
if
they
did
kill
thy
husband
then
be
joyful
because
the
law
hath
ta
en
revenge
on
them
no
no
they
would
not
do
so
foul
a
deed
witness
the
sorrow
that
their
sister
makes
gentle
lavinia
let
me
kiss
thy
lips
or
make
some
sign
how
i
may
do
thee
ease
shall
thy
good
uncle
and
thy
brother
lucius
and
thou
and
i
sit
round
about
some
fountain
looking
all
downwards
to
behold
our
cheeks
how
they
are
stain
d
as
meadows
yet
not
dry
with
miry
slime
left
on
them
by
a
flood
and
in
the
fountain
shall
we
gaze
so
long
till
the
fresh
taste
be
taken
from
that
clearness
and
made
a
brine
pit
with
our
bitter
tears
or
shall
we
cut
away
our
hands
like
thine
or
shall
we
bite
our
tongues
and
in
dumb
shows
pass
the
remainder
of
our
hateful
days
what
shall
we
do
let
us
that
have
our
tongues
plot
some
deuce
of
further
misery
to
make
us
wonder
d
at
in
time
to
come
lucius
sweet
father
cease
your
tears
for
at
your
grief
see
how
my
wretched
sister

and
weeps

i
said
to
thee
his
napkin
with
his
true
tears
all
bewet
can
do
no
service
on
her
sorrowful
cheeks
o
what
a
sympathy
of

o
here
i
lift
this
one
hand
up
to

and
bow
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
if
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
to
that
i
call
to
lavinia
what
wilt
thou
kneel
with
me
do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
or
with
our
sighs
we
ll
breathe
the
welkin
dim
and
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
when
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
marcus
andronicus
o
brother
speak
with
possibilities
and
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
titus
andronicus
is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
marcus
andronicus
but
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
titus
andronicus
if
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
then
into
limits
could
i
bind
my
woes
when
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
o
erflow
if
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
threatening
the
welkin
with
his
big
swoln
face
and
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
i
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
she
is
the
weeping
welkin
i
the
earth
then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
become
a
deluge
overflow
d
and
drown
d
for
why
my
bowels
cannot
hide
her
woes
but
like
a
drunkard
must
i
vomit
them
then
give
me
leave
for
losers
will
have
leave
to
ease
their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues
enter
a
messenger
with
two
heads

ill
art
thou
repaid
for

so
deep
a
wound

let
life
bear
his

where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
lavinia
kisses

andronicus
alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
as
frozen
water
to
a
starved

broke
my
heart
with
extreme
laughter
i
pry
d
me
through
the
crevice
of
a
wall
when
for
his
hand
he

his
two

heads
beheld
his
tears
and
laugh
d
so
heartily
that
both
mine
eyes
were
rainy
like
to

and
when
i
told
the

swooned
almost
at

gave
me
twenty
kisses

rome
the
civil
wound
my
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
nor
can
i
utter
all
our
bitter
grief
but
floods
of
tears
will
drown
my
oratory
and
break
my
utterance
even
in
the
time
when
it
should
move
you
to

her
enemies
unto
the

unkindly
banished

gates
shut
on
me
and

d
weeping
out
to
beg
relief
among
rome
