much
ado
about
nothing
act
i
scene
i
before
leonato
s
house
enter
leonato
hero
and
beatrice
with
a
messenger
leonato
i
learn
in
this
letter
that
don
peter
of
arragon
comes
this
night
to
messina
messenger
he
is
very
near
by
this
he
was
not
three
leagues
off
when
i
left
him
leonato
how
many
gentlemen
have
you
lost
in
this
action
messenger
but
few
of
any
sort
and
none
of
name
leonato
a
victory
is
twice
itself
when
the
achiever
brings
home
full
numbers
i
find
here
that
don
peter
hath
bestowed
much
honour
on
a
young
florentine
called
claudio
messenger
much
deserved
on
his
part
and
equally
remembered
by
don
pedro
he
hath
borne
himself
beyond
the
promise
of
his
age
doing
in
the
figure
of
a
lamb
the
feats
of
a
lion
he
hath
indeed
better
bettered
expectation
than
you
must
expect
of
me
to
tell
you
how
leonato
he
hath
an
uncle
here
in
messina
will
be
very
much
glad
of
it
messenger
i
have
already
delivered
him
letters
and
there
appears
much
joy
in
him
even
so
much
that
joy
could
not
show
itself
modest
enough
without
a
badge
of
bitterness
leonato
did
he
break
out
into
tears
messenger
in
great
measure
leonato
a
kind
overflow
of
kindness
there
are
no
faces
truer
than
those
that
are
so
washed
how
much
better
is
it
to
weep
at
joy
than
to
joy
at
weeping
beatrice
i
pray
you
is
signior
mountanto
returned
from
the
wars
or
no
messenger

know

pleasant

the
flight

my
uncle

fool
reading

challenge
subscribed
for
cupid
and
challenged
him
at
the
bird
bolt
i
pray
you
how
many
hath
he
killed
and
eaten
in
these
wars
but
how

done
good
service

these
wars

an
excellent
stomach
messenger
and
a
good
soldier
too
lady
beatrice

a
good
soldier

a
lady
but
what
is
he

a
lord
messenger
a
lord
to
a
lord
a
man
to
a
man
stuffed
with
all
honourable
virtues
beatrice
it
is
so
indeed
he
is
no
less
than
a
stuffed
man
but
for
the
stuffing
well
we
are
all
mortal
leonato
you
must
not
sir
mistake
my
niece
there
is
a
kind
of
merry
war
betwixt
signior
benedick
and
her
they
never
meet
but
there
s
a
skirmish
of
wit
between
them
beatrice
alas
he
gets
nothing
by
that
in
our
last
conflict
four
of
his
five
wits
went
halting
off
and
now
is
the
whole
man
governed
with
one
so
that
if
he
have
wit
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
let
him
bear
it
for
a
difference
between
himself
and
his
horse
for
it
is
all
the
wealth
that
he
hath
left
to
be
known
a
reasonable
creature
who
is
his
companion
now
he
hath
every
month
a
new
sworn
brother
messenger
is
t
possible
beatrice
very
easily
possible
he
wears
his
faith
but
as
the
fashion
of
his
hat
it
ever
changes
with
the
next
block
messenger
i
see
lady
the
gentleman
is
not
in
your
books
beatrice
no
an
he
were
i
would
burn
my
study
but
i
pray
you
who
is
his
companion
is
there
no
young
squarer
now
that
will
make
a
voyage
with
him
to
the
devil
messenger
he
is
most
in
the
company
of
the
right
noble
claudio
beatrice
o
lord
he
will
hang
upon
him
like
a
disease
he
is
sooner
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
god
help
the
noble
claudio
if
he
have
caught
the
benedick
it
will
cost
him
a
thousand
pound
ere
a
be
cured
messenger
i
will
hold
friends
with
you
lady
beatrice
do
good
friend
leonato
you
will
never
run
mad
niece
beatrice
no
not
till
a
hot
january
messenger
don
pedro
is
approached
enter
don
pedro
don
john
claudio
benedick
and
balthasar
don
pedro
good
signior
leonato
you
are
come
to
meet
your
trouble
the
fashion
of
the
world
is
to
avoid
cost
and
you
encounter
it
leonato
never
came
trouble
to
my
house
in
the
likeness
of
your
grace
for
trouble
being
gone
comfort
should
remain
but
when
you
depart
from
me
sorrow
abides
and
happiness
takes
his
leave
don
pedro
you
embrace
your
charge
too
willingly
i
think
this
is
your
daughter
leonato
her
mother
hath
many
times
told
me
so
benedick
were
you
in
doubt
sir
that
you
asked
her
leonato
signior
benedick
no
for
then
were
you
a
child
don
pedro
you
have
it
full
benedick
we
may
guess
by
this
what
you
are
being
a
man
truly
the
lady
fathers
herself
be
happy
lady
for
you
are
like
an
honourable
father
benedick
if
signior
leonato
be
her
father
she
would
not
have
his
head
on
her
shoulders
for
all
messina
as
like
him
as
she
is
beatrice
i
wonder
that
you
will
still
be
talking
signior
benedick
nobody
marks
you
benedick
what
my
dear
lady
disdain
are
you
yet
living
beatrice
is
it
possible
disdain
should
die
while
she
hath
such
meet
food
to
feed
it
as
signior
benedick
courtesy
itself
must
convert
to
disdain
if
you
come
in
her
presence
benedick
then
is
courtesy
a
turncoat
but
it
is
certain
i
am
loved
of
all
ladies
only
you
excepted
and
i
would
i
could
find
in
my
heart
that
i
had
not
a
hard
heart
for
truly
i
love
none
beatrice
a
dear
happiness
to
women
they
would
else
have
been
troubled
with
a
pernicious
suitor
i
thank
god
and
my
cold
blood
i
am
of
your
humour
for
that
i
had
rather
hear
my
dog
bark
at
a
crow
than
a
man
swear
he
loves
me
benedick
god
keep
your
ladyship
still
in
that
mind
so
some
gentleman
or
other
shall
scape
a
predestinate
scratched
face
beatrice
scratching
could
not
make
it
worse
an
twere
such
a
face
as
yours
were
benedick
well
you
are
a
rare
parrot
teacher
beatrice
a
bird
of
my
tongue
is
better
than
a
beast
of
yours
benedick
i
would
my
horse
had
the
speed
of
your
tongue
and
so
good
a
continuer
but
keep
your
way
i
god
s
name
i
have
done
beatrice
you
always
end
with
a
jade
s
trick
i
know
you
of
old
don
pedro
that
is
the
sum
of
all
leonato
signior
claudio
and
signior
benedick
my
dear
friend
leonato
hath
invited
you
all
i
tell
him
we
shall
stay
here
at
the
least
a
month
and
he
heartily
prays
some
occasion
may
detain
us
longer
i
dare
swear
he
is
no
hypocrite
but
prays
from
his
heart
leonato
if
you
swear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
forsworn
to
don
john
let
me
bid
you

reconciled
to
the
prince
your
brother
i
owe
you
all
duty
don
john
i
thank
you

not
of
many
words
but
i
thank
you
leonato
please

your
grace
lead
on
don
pedro
your
hand
leonato
we
will
go
together
exeunt

and
claudio
claudio
benedick
didst
thou
note
the
daughter
of
signior
leonato
benedick
i
noted
her
not
but
i
looked
on
her
claudio
is
she
not
a
modest
young
lady
benedick
do
you
question
me
as
an
honest
man
should
do
for
my
simple
true
judgment
or
would
you
have
me
speak
after
my
custom
as
being
a
professed
tyrant
to
their
sex
claudio
no
i
pray
thee
speak
in
sober
judgment
benedick
why
i
faith
methinks
she
s
too
low
for
a
high
praise
too
brown
for
a
fair
praise
and
too
little
for
a
great
praise
only
this
commendation
i
can
afford
her
that
were
she
other
than
she
is
she
were
unhandsome
and
being
no
other
but
as
she
is
i
do
not
like
her
claudio
thou
thinkest
i
am
in
sport
i
pray
thee
tell
me
truly
how
thou
likest
her
benedick
would
you
buy
her
that
you
inquire
after
her
claudio
can
the
world
buy
such
a
jewel
benedick
yea
and
a
case
to
put
it
into
but
speak
you
this
with
a
sad
brow
or
do
you
play
the
flouting
jack
to
tell
us
cupid
is
a
good
hare
finder
and
vulcan
a
rare
carpenter
come
in
what
key
shall
a
man
take
you
to
go
in
the
song
claudio
in
mine
eye
she
is
the
sweetest
lady
that
ever
i
looked
on
benedick
i
can
see
yet
without
spectacles
and
i
see
no
such
matter
there
s
her
cousin
an
she
were
not
possessed
with
a
fury
exceeds
her
as
much
in
beauty
as
the
first
of
may
doth
the
last
of
december
but
i
hope
you
have
no
intent
to
turn
husband
have
you
claudio
i
would
scarce
trust
myself
though
i
had
sworn
the
contrary
if
hero
would
be
my
wife
benedick
is
t
come
to
this
in
faith
hath
not
the
world
one
man
but
he
will
wear
his
cap
with
suspicion
shall
i
never
see
a
bachelor
of
three
score
again
go
to
i
faith
an
thou
wilt
needs
thrust
thy
neck
into
a
yoke
wear
the
print
of
it
and
sigh
away
sundays
look
don
pedro
is
returned
to
seek
you
re
enter
don
pedro
don
pedro
what
secret
hath
held
you
here
that
you
followed
not
to
leonato
s
benedick
i
would
your
grace
would
constrain
me
to
tell
don
pedro
i
charge
thee
on
thy
allegiance
benedick
you
hear
count
claudio
i
can
be
secret
as
a
dumb
man
i
would
have
you
think
so
but
on
my
allegiance
mark
you
this
on
my
allegiance
he
is
in
love
with
who
now
that
is
your
grace
s
part
mark
how
short
his
answer
is
with
hero
leonato
s
short
daughter
claudio
if
this
were
so
so
were
it
uttered
benedick
like
the
old
tale
my
lord
it
is
not
so
nor
twas
not
so
but
indeed
god
forbid
it
should
be
so
claudio
if
my
passion
change
not
shortly
god
forbid
it
should
be
otherwise
don
pedro
amen
if
you
love
her
for
the
lady
is
very
well
worthy
claudio
you
speak
this
to
fetch
me
in
my
lord
don
pedro
by
my
troth
i
speak
my
thought
claudio
and
in
faith
my
lord
i
spoke
mine
benedick
and
by
my
two
faiths
and
troths
my
lord
i
spoke
mine
claudio
that
i
love
her
i
feel
don
pedro
that
she
is
worthy
i
know
benedick
that
i
neither
feel
how
she
should
be
loved
nor
know
how
she
should
be
worthy
is
the
opinion
that
fire
cannot
melt
out
of
me
i
will
die
in
it
at
the
stake
don
pedro
thou
wast
ever
an
obstinate
heretic
in
the
despite
of
beauty
claudio
and
never
could
maintain
his
part
but
in
the
force
of
his
will
benedick
that
a
woman
conceived
me
i
thank
her
that
she
brought
me
up
i
likewise
give
her
most
humble
thanks
but
that
i
will
have
a
recheat
winded
in
my
forehead
or
hang
my
bugle
in
an
invisible
baldrick
all
women
shall
pardon
me
because
i
will
not
do
them
the
wrong
to
mistrust
any
i
will
do
myself
the
right
to
trust
none
and
the
fine
is
for
the
which
i
may
go
the
finer
i
will
live
a
bachelor
don
pedro
i
shall
see
thee
ere
i
die
look
pale
with
love
benedick
with
anger
with
sickness
or
with
hunger
my
lord
not
with
love
prove
that
ever
i
lose
more
blood
with
love
than
i
will
get
again
with
drinking
pick
out
mine
eyes
with
a
ballad
maker
s
pen
and
hang
me
up
at
the
door
of
a
brothel
house
for
the
sign
of
blind
cupid
don
pedro
well
if
ever
thou
dost
fall
from
this
faith
thou
wilt
prove
a
notable
argument
benedick
if
i
do
hang
me
in
a
bottle
like
a
cat
and
shoot
at
me
and
he
that
hits
me
let
him
be
clapped
on
the
shoulder
and
called
adam
don
pedro
well
as
time
shall
try
in
time
the
savage
bull
doth
bear
the
yoke
benedick
the
savage
bull
may
but
if
ever
the
sensible
benedick
bear
it
pluck
off
the
bull
s
horns
and
set
them
in
my
forehead
and
let
me
be
vilely
painted
and
in
such
great
letters
as
they
write
here
is
good
horse
to
hire
let
them
signify
under
my
sign
here
you
may
see
benedick
the
married
man
claudio
if
this
should
ever
happen
thou
wouldst
be
horn
mad
don
pedro
nay
if
cupid
have
not
spent
all
his
quiver
in
venice
thou
wilt
quake
for
this
shortly
benedick
i
look
for
an
earthquake
too
then
don
pedro
well
you
temporize
with
the
hours
in
the
meantime
good
signior
benedick
repair
to
leonato
s
commend
me
to
him
and
tell
him
i
will
not
fail
him
at
supper
for
indeed
he
hath
made
great
preparation
benedick
i
have
almost
matter
enough
in
me
for
such
an
embassage
and
so
i
commit
you
claudio
to
the
tuition
of
god
from
my
house
if
i
had
it
don
pedro
the
sixth
of
july
your
loving
friend
benedick
benedick
nay
mock
not
mock
not
the
body
of
your
discourse
is
sometime
guarded
with
fragments
and
the
guards
are
but
slightly
basted
on
neither
ere
you
flout
old
ends
any
further
examine
your
conscience
and
so
i
leave
you
exit
claudio
my
liege
your
highness
now
may
do
me
good
don
pedro
my
love
is
thine
to
teach
teach
it
but
how
and
thou
shalt
see
how
apt
it
is
to
learn
any
hard
lesson
that
may
do
thee
good
claudio
hath
leonato
any
son
my
lord
don
pedro
no
child
but
hero
she
s
his
only
heir
dost
thou
affect
her
claudio
claudio
o
my
lord
when
you
went
onward
on
this
ended
action
i
look
d
upon
her
with
a
soldier
s
eye
that
liked
but
had
a
rougher
task
in
hand
than
to
drive
liking
to
the
name
of
love
but
now
i
am
return
d
and
that
war
thoughts
have
left
their
places
vacant
in
their
rooms
come
thronging
soft
and
delicate
desires
all
prompting
me
how
fair
young
hero
is
saying
i
liked
her
ere
i
went
to
wars
don
pedro
thou
wilt
be
like
a
lover
presently
and
tire
the
hearer
with
a
book
of
words
if
thou
dost
love
fair
hero
cherish
it
and
i
will
break
with
her
and
with
her
father
and
thou
shalt
have
her
was
t
not
to
this
end
that
thou
began
st
to
twist
so
fine
a
story
claudio
how
sweetly
you
do
minister
to
love
that
know
love
s
grief
by
his
complexion
but
lest
my
liking
might
too
sudden
seem
i
would
have
salved
it
with
a
longer
treatise
don
pedro
what
need
the
bridge
much
broader
than
the
flood
the
fairest
grant
is
the
necessity
look
what
will
serve
is
fit
tis
once
thou
lovest
and
i
will
fit
thee
with
the
remedy
i
know
we
shall
have
revelling
to
night
i
will
assume
thy
part
in
some
disguise
and
tell
fair
hero
i
am
claudio
and
in
her
bosom
i
ll
unclasp
my
heart
and
take
her
hearing
prisoner
with
the
force
and
strong
encounter
of
my
amorous
tale
then
after
to
her
father
will
i
break

strange
news
that
you

dreamt

are
they
good

as
the
event

them
but
they
have
a
good
cover
they
show
well
outward
the
prince
and
count
claudio
walking
in
a
thick
pleached
alley
in
mine
orchard
were
thus
much
overheard
by
a
man
of
mine
the
prince
discovered
to
claudio
that
he
loved
my
niece
your
daughter
and
meant
to
acknowledge
it
this
night
in
a
dance
and
if
he
found
her
accordant
he
meant
to
take
the
present
time
by
the
top
and
instantly
break
with
you
of
it
leonato
hath
the
fellow
any
wit
that
told
you
this
antonio
a
good
sharp
fellow
i
will
send
for
him
and
question
him
yourself
leonato
no
no
we
will
hold
it
as
a
dream
till
it
appear
itself
but
i
will
acquaint
my
daughter
withal
that
she
may
be
the
better
prepared
for
an
answer
if
peradventure
this
be
true
go
you
and
tell
her
of
it
enter
attendants
cousins
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
o
i
cry
you
mercy
friend
go
you
with
me
and
i
will
use
your
skill
good
cousin
have
a
care
this
busy
time
exeunt
scene
iii
the
same
enter
don
john
and
conrade
conrade
what
the
good
year
my
lord
why
are
you
thus
out
of
measure
sad
don
john
there
is
no
measure
in
the
occasion
that
breeds
therefore
the
sadness
is
without
limit
conrade
you
should
hear
reason
don
john
and
when
i
have
heard
it
what
blessing
brings
it
conrade
if
not
a
present
remedy
at
least
a
patient
sufferance
don
john
i
wonder
that
thou
being
as
thou
sayest
thou
art
born
under
saturn
goest
about
to
apply
a
moral
medicine
to
a
mortifying
mischief
i
cannot
hide
what
i
am
i
must
be
sad
when
i
have
cause
and
smile
at
no
man
s
jests
eat
when
i
have
stomach
and
wait
for
no
man
s
leisure
sleep
when
i
am
drowsy
and
tend
on
no
man
s
business
laugh
when
i
am
merry
and
claw
no
man
in
his
humour
conrade
yea
but
you
must
not
make
the
full
show
of
this
till
you
may
do
it
without
controlment
you
have
of
late
stood
out
against
your
brother
and
he
hath
ta
en
you
newly
into
his
grace
where
it
is
impossible
you
should
take
true
root
but
by
the
fair
weather
that
you
make
yourself
it
is
needful
that
you
frame
the
season
for
your
own
harvest
don
john
i
had
rather
be
a
canker
in
a
hedge
than
a
rose
in
his
grace
and
it
better
fits
my
blood
to
be
disdained
of
all
than
to
fashion
a
carriage
to
rob
love
from
any
in
this
though
i
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
flattering
honest
man
it
must
not
be
denied
but
i
am
a
plain
dealing
villain
i
am
trusted
with
a
muzzle
and
enfranchised
with
a
clog
therefore
i
have
decreed
not
to
sing
in
my
cage
if
i
had
my
mouth
i
would
bite
if
i
had
my
liberty
i
would
do
my
liking
in
the
meantime
let
me
be
that
i
am
and
seek
not
to
alter
me
conrade
can
you
make
no
use
of
your
discontent
don
john
i
make
all
use
of
it
for
i
use
it
only

scene
i
a
hall
in
leonato
s
house
enter
leonato
antonio
hero
beatrice
and
others
leonato
was
not
count
john
here
at
supper
antonio
i
saw
him
not
beatrice
how
tartly
that
gentleman
looks
i
never
can
see
him
but
i
am
heart
burned
an
hour
after
hero
he
is
of
a
very
melancholy
disposition
beatrice
he
were
an
excellent
man
that
were
made
just
in
the
midway
between
him
and
benedick
the
one
is
too
like
an
image
and
says
nothing
and
the
other
too
like
my
lady
s
eldest
son
evermore
tattling
leonato
then
half
signior
benedick
s
tongue
in
count
john
s
mouth
and
half
count
john
s
melancholy
in
signior
benedick
s
face
beatrice
with
a
good
leg
and
a
good
foot
uncle
and
money
enough
in
his
purse
such
a
man
would
win
any
woman
in
the
world
if
a
could
get
her
good
will
leonato
by
my
troth
niece
thou
wilt
never
get
thee
a
husband
if
thou
be
so
shrewd
of
thy
tongue
antonio
in
faith
she
s
too
curst
beatrice
too
curst
is
more
than
curst
i
shall
lessen
god
s
sending
that
way
for
it
is
said
god
sends
a
curst
cow
short
horns
but
to
a
cow
too
curst
he
sends
none
leonato
so
by
being
too
curst
god
will
send
you
no
horns
beatrice
just
if
he
send
me
no
husband
for
the
which
blessing
i
am
at
him
upon
my
knees
every
morning
and
evening
lord
i
could
not
endure
a
husband
with
a
beard
on
his
face
i
had
rather
lie
in
the
woollen
leonato
you
may
light
on
a
husband
that
hath
no
beard
beatrice
what
should
i
do
with
him
dress
him
in
my
apparel
and
make
him
my
waiting
gentlewoman
he
that
hath
a
beard
is
more
than
a
youth
and
he
that
hath
no
beard
is
less
than
a
man
and
he
that
is
more
than
a
youth
is
not
for
me
and
he
that
is
less
than
a
man
i
am
not
for
him
therefore
i
will
even
take
sixpence
in
earnest
of
the
bear
ward
and
lead
his
apes
into
hell
leonato
well
then
go
you
into
hell
beatrice
no
but
to
the
gate
and
there
will
the
devil
meet
me
like
an
old
cuckold
with
horns
on
his
head
and
say
get
you
to
heaven
beatrice
get
you
to
heaven
here
s
no
place
for
you
maids
so
deliver
i
up
my
apes
and
away
to
saint
peter
for
the
heavens
he
shows
me
where
the
bachelors
sit
and
there
live
we
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
antonio
[to
hero]
well
niece
i
trust
you
will
be
ruled
by
your
father
beatrice
yes
faith
it
is
my
cousin
s
duty
to
make
curtsy
and
say
father
as
it
please
you
but
yet
for
all
that
cousin
let
him
be
a
handsome
fellow
or
else
make
another
curtsy
and
say
father
as
it
please
me
leonato
well
niece
i
hope
to
see
you
one
day
fitted
with
a
husband
beatrice
not
till
god
make
men
of
some
other
metal
than
earth
would
it
not
grieve
a
woman
to
be
overmastered
with
a
pierce
of
valiant
dust
to
make
an
account
of
her
life
to
a
clod
of
wayward
marl
no
uncle
i
ll
none
adam
s
sons
are
my
brethren
and
truly
i
hold
it
a
sin
to
match
in
my
kindred
leonato
daughter
remember
what
i
told
you
if
the
prince
do
solicit
you
in
that
kind
you
know
your
answer
beatrice
the
fault
will
be
in
the
music
cousin
if
you
be
not
wooed
in
good
time
if
the
prince
be
too
important
tell
him
there
is
measure
in
every
thing
and
so
dance
out
the
answer
for
hear
me
hero
wooing
wedding
and
repenting
is
as
a
scotch
jig
a
measure
and
a
cinque
pace
the
first
suit
is
hot
and
hasty
like
a
scotch
jig
and
full
as
fantastical
the
wedding
mannerly
modest
as
a
measure
full
of
state
and
ancientry
and
then
comes
repentance
and
with
his
bad
legs
falls
into
the
cinque
pace
faster
and
faster
till
he
sink
into
his
grave
leonato
cousin
you
apprehend
passing
shrewdly

jester

very
dull
fool
only
his
gift
is
in
devising
impossible
slanders
none
but
libertines
delight
in
him
and
the
commendation
is
not
in
his
wit
but
in
his
villany
for
he
both
pleases
men
and
angers
them
and
then
they
laugh
at
him
and
beat
him
i
am
sure
he
is
in
the
fleet
i
would
he

do
he
ll
but
break
a
comparison
or
two
on
me
which
peradventure
not
marked
or
not
laughed
at
strikes
him
into
melancholy
and
then
there

a
partridge
wing
saved
for
the
fool
will
eat
no
supper
that
night
music
we
must
follow

any
ill
i
will
leave
them
at
the

turning
dance
then
exeunt
all
except

ill
news

the
prince
wooes
for
himself
friendship

constant
in
all
other
things

office
and
affairs
of
love
therefore
all
hearts
in
love
use
their
own
tongues
let
every
eye
negotiate
for
itself
and
trust
no
agent
for
beauty
is
a
witch
against
whose
charms
faith
melteth
into
blood
this
is
an
accident
of
hourly
proof
which
i
mistrusted
not
farewell
therefore
hero
re
enter
benedick
benedick
count
claudio
claudio
yea
the
same
benedick
come
will
you
go
with
me
claudio
whither
benedick
even
to
the
next
willow
about
your
own
business
county
what
fashion
will
you
wear
the
garland
of
about
your
neck
like
an
usurer
s
chain
or
under
your
arm
like
a
lieutenant
s
scarf
you
must
wear
it
one
way
for
the
prince
hath
got
your
hero
claudio
i
wish
him
joy
of
her
benedick
why
that
s
spoken
like
an
honest
drovier
so
they
sell
bullocks
but
did
you
think
the
prince
would
have
served
you
thus
claudio
i
pray
you
leave
me
benedick
ho
now
you
strike
like
the
blind
man
twas
the
boy
that
stole
your
meat
and
you
ll
beat
the
post
claudio
if
it
will
not
be
i
ll
leave
you
exit
benedick
alas
poor
hurt
fowl

he
creep

that
my
lady
beatrice
should

not
know
me
the
prince
s
fool
ha
it
may
be
i
go
under
that
title
because
i
am
merry
yea
but
so
i
am
apt
to
do
myself
wrong
i
am
not
so
reputed
it
is
the
base
though
bitter
disposition
of
beatrice
that
puts
the
world
into
her
person
and
so
gives
me
out
well
i
ll
be
revenged
as
i
may
re
enter

pedro
don
pedro
now
signior
where
s
the
count
did
you
see
him
benedick
troth
my
lord
i
have
played
the
part
of
lady
fame
i
found
him
here
as
melancholy
as
a
lodge
in
a
warren
i
told
him
and
i
think
i
told
him
true
that
your
grace
had
got
the
good
will
of
this
young
lady
and
i
offered
him
my
company
to
a
willow
tree
either
to
make
him
a
garland
as
being
forsaken
or
to
bind
him
up
a
rod
as
being
worthy
to
be
whipped
don
pedro
to
be
whipped
what
s
his
fault
benedick
the
flat
transgression
of
a
schoolboy
who
being
overjoyed
with
finding
a
birds
nest
shows
it
his
companion
and
he
steals
it
don
pedro
wilt
thou
make
a
trust
a
transgression
the
transgression
is
in
the
stealer
benedick
yet
it
had
not
been
amiss
the
rod
had
been
made
and
the
garland
too
for
the
garland
he
might
have
worn
himself
and
the
rod
he
might
have
bestowed
on
you
who
as
i
take
it
have
stolen
his
birds
nest
don
pedro
i
will
but
teach
them
to
sing
and
restore
them
to
the
owner
benedick
if
their
singing
answer
your
saying
by
my
faith
you
say
honestly
don
pedro
the
lady
beatrice
hath
a
quarrel
to
you
the
gentleman
that
danced
with
her
told
her
she
is
much
wronged
by
you
benedick
o
she
misused
me
past
the
endurance
of
a
block
an
oak
but
with
one
green
leaf
on
it
would
have
answered
her
my
very
visor
began
to
assume
life
and
scold
with
her
she
told
me
not
thinking
i
had
been
myself
that
i
was
the
prince
s
jester
that
i
was
duller
than
a
great
thaw
huddling
jest
upon
jest
with
such
impossible
conveyance
upon
me
that
i
stood
like
a
man
at
a
mark
with
a
whole
army
shooting
at
me
she
speaks
poniards
and
every
word
stabs
if
her
breath
were
as
terrible
as
her
terminations
there
were
no
living
near
her
she
would
infect
to
the
north
star
i
would
not
marry
her
though
she
were
endowed
with
all
that
adam
bad
left
him
before
he
transgressed
she
would
have
made
hercules
have
turned
spit
yea
and
have
cleft
his
club
to
make
the
fire
too
come
talk
not
of
her
you
shall
find
her
the
infernal
ate
in
good
apparel
i
would
to
god
some
scholar
would
conjure
her
for
certainly
while
she
is
here
a
man
may
live
as
quiet
in
hell
as
in
a
sanctuary
and
people
sin
upon
purpose
because
they
would
go
thither
so
indeed
all
disquiet
horror
and
perturbation
follows
her
don
pedro
look
here

comes

long
a
breathing
but

assistance

shall
give
you
direction

gentle
hero
hero
i
will
do
any
modest
office
my
lord
to
help
my
cousin
to
a
good
husband
don
pedro
and
benedick
is
not
the
unhopefullest
husband
that
i
know
thus
far
can
i
praise
him
he
is
of
a
noble
strain
of
approved
valour
and
confirmed
honesty
i
will
teach
you
how
to
humour
your
cousin
that
she
shall
fall
in
love
with
benedick
and
i
with
your
two
helps
will
so
practise
on
benedick
that
in
despite
of
his
quick
wit
and
his
queasy
stomach
he
shall
fall
in
love
with
beatrice
if
we
can
do
this
cupid
is
no
longer
an
archer
hi

glory
shall
be
ours
for
we
are
the
only
love
gods
go
in
with
me
and
i
will
tell
you
my
drift
exeunt
scene
ii
the
same
enter
don
john
and
borachio
don
john
it
is
so
the
count
claudio
shall
marry
the
daughter
of
leonato
borachio
yea
my
lord
but
i
can
cross
it
don
john
any
bar
any
cross
any
impediment
will
be
medicinable
to
me
i
am
sick
in
displeasure
to
him
and
whatsoever
comes
athwart
his
affection
ranges
evenly
with
mine
how
canst
thou
cross
this
marriage
borachio
not
honestly
my
lord
but
so
covertly
that
no
dishonesty
shall
appear
in
me
don
john
show
me
briefly
how
borachio
i
think
i
told
your
lordship
a
year
since
how
much
i
am
in
the
favour
of
margaret
the
waiting
gentlewoman
to
hero
don
john
i
remember
borachio
i
can
at
any
unseasonable
instant
of
the
night
appoint
her
to
look
out
at
her
lady
s
chamber
window
don
john
what
life
is
in
that
to
be
the
death
of
this
marriage
borachio
the
poison
of
that
lies
in
you
to
temper
go
you
to
the
prince
your
brother
spare
not
to
tell
him
that
he
hath
wronged
his
honour
in
marrying
the
renowned
claudio
whose
estimation
do
you
mightily
hold
up
to
a
contaminated
stale
such
a
one
as
hero
don
john
what
proof
shall
i
make
of
that
borachio
proof
enough
to
misuse
the
prince
to
vex
claudio
to
undo
hero
and
kill
leonato
look
you
for
any
other
issue
don
john
only
to
despite
them
i
will
endeavour
any
thing
borachio
go
then
find
me
a
meet
hour
to
draw
don
pedro
and
the
count
claudio
alone
tell
them
that
you
know
that
hero
loves
me
intend
a
kind
of
zeal
both
to
the
prince
and
claudio
as
in
love
of
your
brother
s
honour
who
hath
made
this
match
and
his
friend
s
reputation
who
is
thus
like
to
be
cozened
with
the
semblance
of
a
maid
that
you
have
discovered
thus
they
will
scarcely
believe
this
without
trial
offer
them
instances
which
shall
bear
no
less
likelihood
than
to
see
me
at
her
chamber
window
hear
me
call
margaret
hero
hear
margaret
term
me
claudio
and
bring
them
to
see
this
the
very
night
before
the
intended
wedding
for
in
the
meantime
i
will
so
fashion
the
matter
that
hero
shall
be
absent
and
there
shall
appear
such
seeming
truth
of
hero
s
disloyalty
that
jealousy
shall
be
called
assurance
and
all
the
preparation
overthrown
don
john
grow
this
to
what
adverse
issue
it
can
i
will
put
it
in
practise
be
cunning
in
the
working
this
and
thy
fee
is
a
thousand
ducats
borachio
be
you
constant
in
the
accusation
and
my
cunning
shall
not
shame
me
don
john
i
will
presently
go
learn
their
day
of
marriage
exeunt
scene
iii
leonato
s
orchard
enter
benedick
benedick
boy
enter
boy
boy
signior
benedick
in
my
chamber
window
lies
a
book
bring
it
hither
to
me
in
the
orchard
boy
i
am
here
already
sir
benedick
i
know
that
but
i
would
have
thee
hence
and
here
again
exit
boy
i
do
much
wonder
that
one
man
seeing
how
much
another
man
is
a
fool
when
he
dedicates
his
behaviors
to
love
will
after
he
hath
laughed
at
such
shallow
follies
in
others
become
the
argument
of
his
own
scorn
by
failing
in
love
and
such
a
man
is
claudio
i
have
known
when
there
was
no
music
with
him
but
the
drum
and
the
fife
and
now
had
he
rather
hear
the
tabour
and
the
pipe
i
have
known
when
he
would
have
walked
ten
mile
a
foot
to
see
a
good
armour
and
now
will
he
lie
ten
nights
awake
carving
the
fashion
of
a
new
doublet
he
was
wont
to
speak
plain
and
to
the
purpose
like
an
honest
man
and
a
soldier
and
now
is
he
turned
orthography
his
words
are
a
very
fantastical
banquet
just
so
many
strange
dishes
may
i
be
so
converted
and
see
with
these
eyes
i
cannot
tell
i
think
not
i
will
not
be
sworn
but
love
may
transform
me
to
an
oyster
but
i
ll
take
my
oath
on
it
till
he
have
made
an
oyster
of
me
he
shall
never
make
me
such
a
fool
one
woman
is
fair
yet
i
am
well
another
is
wise
yet
i
am
well
another
virtuous
yet
i
am
well
but
till
all
graces
be
in
one
woman
one
woman
shall
not
come
in
my
grace
rich
she
shall
be
that
s
certain
wise
or
i
ll
none
virtuous
or
i

never
cheapen

never
look
on
her
mild
or
come
not
near
me

for
an
angel
of
good
discourse

excellent
musician
and
her
hair
shall
be
of
what
colour

strange
face
on
his

perfection
i
pray
thee
sing
and
let
me
woo
no
more
balthasar
because

a
wooer
doth
commence
his
suit

crotchets

speaks
note
notes
forsooth
and
nothing
air
benedick
now
divine
air

his
soul
ravished
is
it
not
strange
that
sheeps

of
men

bodies
well
a
horn
for
my
money
when
all
s
done

one
foot
in

one
on

one
thing
constant
never
then
sigh
not
so
but

have
it
at
the
lady
hero
s
chamber
window
balthasar
the
best
i
can
my
lord
don
pedro
do
so
farewell
exit
balthasar
come
hither
leonato
what
was
it
you
told
me
of
to
day
that
your
niece
beatrice
was
in
love
with
signior
benedick
claudio
o
ay
stalk
on
stalk
on
the
fowl
sits
i
did
never
think
that
lady
would
have
loved
any
man
leonato
no
nor
i
neither
but
most
wonderful
that
she
should
so
dote
on
signior
benedick
whom
she
hath
in
all
outward
behaviors
seemed
ever
to
abhor
benedick
is
t
possible
sits
the
wind
in
that
corner
leonato
by
my
troth
my
lord
i
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
it
but
that
she
loves
him
with
an
enraged
affection
it
is
past
the
infinite
of
thought
don
pedro
may
be
she
doth
but
counterfeit
claudio
faith
like
enough
leonato
o
god
counterfeit
there
was
never
counterfeit
of
passion
came
so
near
the
life
of
passion
as
she
discovers
it
don
pedro
why
what
effects
of
passion
shows
she
claudio
bait
the
hook
well
this
fish
will
bite
leonato
what
effects
my
lord
she
will
sit
you
you
heard
my
daughter
tell
you
how
claudio
she
did
indeed
don
pedro
how
how
pray
you
you
amaze
me
i
would
have
i
thought
her
spirit
had
been
invincible
against
all
assaults
of
affection
leonato
i
would
have
sworn
it
had
my
lord
especially
against
benedick
benedick
i
should
think
this
a
gull
but
that
the
white
bearded
fellow
speaks
it
knavery
cannot
sure
hide
himself
in
such
reverence
claudio
he
hath
ta
en
the
infection
hold
it
up
don
pedro
hath
she
made
her
affection
known
to
benedick
leonato
no
and
swears
she
never
will
that
s
her
torment
claudio
tis
true
indeed
so
your
daughter
says
shall
i
says
she
that
have
so
oft
encountered
him
with
scorn
write
to
him
that
i
love
him
leonato
this
says
she
now
when
she
is
beginning
to
write
to
him
for
she
ll
be
up
twenty
times
a
night
and
there
will
she
sit
in
her
smock
till
she
have
writ
a
sheet
of
paper
my
daughter
tells
us
all
claudio
now
you
talk
of
a
sheet
of
paper
i
remember
a
pretty
jest
your
daughter
told
us
of
leonato
o
when
she
had
writ
it
and
was
reading
it
over
she
found
benedick
and
beatrice
between
the
sheet
claudio
that
leonato
o
she
tore
the
letter
into
a
thousand
halfpence
railed
at
herself
that
she
should
be
so
immodest
to
write
to
one
that
she
knew
would
flout
her
i
measure
him
says
she
by
my
own
spirit
for
i
should
flout
him
if
he
writ
to
me
yea
though
i
love
him
i
should
claudio
then
down
upon
her
knees
she
falls
weeps
sobs
beats
her
heart
tears
her
hair
prays
curses
o
sweet
benedick
god
give
me
patience
leonato
she
doth
indeed
my
daughter
says
so
and
the
ecstasy
hath
so
much
overborne
her
that
my
daughter
is
sometime
afeared
she
will
do
a
desperate
outrage
to
herself
it
is
very
true
don
pedro
it
were
good
that
benedick
knew
of
it
by
some
other
if
she
will
not
discover
it
claudio
to
what
end
he
would
make
but
a
sport
of
it
and
torment
the
poor
lady
worse
don
pedro
an
he
should
it
were
an
alms
to
hang
him
she
s
an
excellent
sweet
lady
and
out
of
all
suspicion
she
is
virtuous
claudio
and
she
is
exceeding
wise
don
pedro
in
every
thing
but
in
loving
benedick
leonato
o
my
lord
wisdom
and
blood
combating
in
so
tender
a
body
we
have
ten
proofs
to
one
that
blood
hath
the
victory
i
am
sorry
for
her
as
i
have
just
cause
being
her
uncle
and
her
guardian
don
pedro
i
would
she
had
bestowed
this
dotage
on
me
i
would
have
daffed
all
other
respects
and
made
her
half
myself
i
pray
you
tell
benedick
of
it
and
hear
what
a
will
say
leonato
were
it
good
think
you
claudio
hero
thinks
surely
she
will
die
for
she
says
she
will
die
if
he
love
her
not
and
she
will
die
ere
she
make
her
love
known
and
she
will
die
if
he
woo
her
rather
than
she
will
bate
one
breath
of
her
accustomed
crossness
don
pedro
she
doth
well
if
she
should
make
tender
of
her
love
tis
very
possible
he
ll
scorn
it
for
the
man
as
you
know
all
hath
a
contemptible
spirit
claudio
he
is
a
very
proper
man
don
pedro
he
hath
indeed
a
good
outward
happiness
claudio
before
god
and
in
my
mind
very
wise
don
pedro
he
doth
indeed
show
some
sparks
that
are
like
wit
claudio
and
i
take
him
to
be
valiant
don
pedro
as
hector
i
assure
you
and
in
the
managing
of
quarrels
you
may
say
he
is
wise
for
either
he
avoids
them
with
great
discretion
or
undertakes
them
with
a
most
christian
like
fear
leonato
if
he
do
fear
god
a
must
necessarily
keep
peace
if
he
break
the
peace
he
ought
to
enter
into
a
quarrel
with
fear
and
trembling
don
pedro
and
so
will
he
do
for
the
man
doth
fear
god
howsoever
it
seems
not
in
him
by
some
large
jests
he
will
make
well
i
am
sorry
for
your
niece
shall
we
go
seek
benedick
and
tell
him
of
her
love
claudio
never
tell
him
my
lord
let
her
wear
it
out
with
good
counsel
leonato
nay
that
s
impossible
she
may
wear
her
heart
out
first
don
pedro
well
we
will
hear
further
of
it
by
your
daughter
let
it
cool
the
while
i
love
benedick
well
and
i
could
wish
he
would
modestly
examine
himself
to
see
how
much
he
is
unworthy
so
good
a
lady
leonato
my
lord
will
you
walk
dinner
is
ready
claudio
if
he
do
not
dote
on
her
upon
this
i
will
never
trust
my
expectation
don
pedro
let
there
be
the
same
net
spread
for
her
and
that
must
your
daughter
and
her
gentlewomen
carry
the
sport
will
be
when
they
hold
one
an
opinion
of
another
s
dotage
and
no
such
matter
that
s
the
scene
that
i
would
see
which
will
be
merely
a
dumb
show
let
us
send
her
to
call
him
in
to
dinner
exeunt
don
pedro
claudio
and
leonato
benedick
[coming
forward]
this
can
be
no
trick
the
conference
was
sadly
borne
they
have
the
truth
of
this
from
hero
they
seem
to
pity
the
lady
it
seems
her
affections
have
their
full
bent
love
me
why
it
must
be
requited
i
hear
how
i
am
censured
they
say
i
will
bear
myself
proudly
if
i
perceive
the
love
come
from
her
they
say
too
that
she
will
rather
die
than
give
any
sign
of
affection
i
did
never
think
to
marry
i
must
not
seem
proud
happy
are
they
that
hear
their
detractions
and
can
put
them
to
mending
they
say
the
lady
is
fair
tis
a
truth
i
can
bear
them
witness
and
virtuous
tis
so
i
cannot
reprove
it
and
wise
but
for
loving
me
by
my
troth
it
is
no
addition
to
her
wit
nor
no
great
argument
of
her
folly
for
i
will
be
horribly
in
love
with
her
i
may
chance
have
some
odd
quirks
and
remnants
of
wit
broken
on
me
because
i
have
railed
so
long
against
marriage
but
doth
not
the
appetite
alter
a
man
loves
the
meat
in
his
youth
that
he
cannot
endure
in
his
age
shall
quips
and
sentences
and
these
paper
bullets
of
the
brain
awe
a
man
from
the
career
of
his
humour
no
the
world
must
be
peopled
when
i
said
i
would
die
a
bachelor
i
did
not
think
i
should
live
till
i
were
married
here
comes
beatrice
by
this
day

a
fair

will

for
your
pains

it
had
been
painful
i
would
not
have
come
benedick
you
take
pleasure
then

the
message

double
meaning

that
i
took
no
more
pains
for
those
thanks
than
you
took
pains
to
thank
me
that
s
as
much
as
to
say
any
pains
that
i
take
for
you
is
as
easy
as
thanks
if
i
do
not
take
pity
of
her

am
a
villain
if
i
do
not
love
her
i
am
a
jew
i
will

iii
scene
i
leonato
s
garden

hero
margaret
and
ursula
hero
good
margaret
run
thee
to
the
parlor
there
shalt
thou
find
my
cousin
beatrice
proposing
with
the
prince
and
claudio
whisper
her
ear
and
tell
her
i
and
ursula
walk
in
the
orchard
and
our
whole
discourse
is
all
of
her
say
that
thou
overheard
st
us
and
bid
her
steal
into
the
pleached
bower
where
honeysuckles
ripen
d
by
the
sun
forbid
the
sun
to
enter
like
favourites
made
proud
by
princes
that
advance
their
pride
against
that
power
that
bred
it
there
will
she
hide
her
to
listen
our
purpose
this
is
thy
office
bear
thee
well
in
it
and
leave
us
alone
margaret
i
ll
make
her
come
i
warrant
you
presently
exit
hero
now
ursula
when
beatrice
doth
come
as
we
do
trace
this
alley
up
and
down
our
talk
must
only
be
of
benedick
when
i
do
name
him
let
it
be
thy
part
to
praise
him
more
than
ever
man
did
merit
my
talk
to
thee
must
be
how
benedick
is
sick
in
love
with
beatrice
of
this
matter
is
little
cupid
s
crafty
arrow
made
that
only
wounds
by
hearsay
enter
beatrice
behind
now
begin
for
look
where
beatrice
like
a
lapwing
runs
close
by
the
ground
to
hear
our
conference
ursula
the
pleasant
st
angling
is
to
see
the
fish
cut
with
her
golden
oars
the
silver
stream
and
greedily
devour
the
treacherous
bait
so
angle
we
for
beatrice
who
even
now
is
couched
in
the
woodbine
coverture
fear
you
not
my
part
of
the
dialogue
hero
then
go
we
near
her
that
her
ear
lose
nothing
of
the
false
sweet
bait
that
we
lay
for
it
approaching
the
bower
no
truly
ursula
she
is
too
disdainful
i
know
her
spirits
are
as
coy
and
wild
as
haggerds
of
the
rock
ursula
but
are
you
sure
that
benedick
loves
beatrice
so
entirely
hero
so
says
the
prince
and
my
new
trothed
lord
ursula
and
did
they
bid
you
tell
her
of
it
madam
hero
they
did
entreat
me
to
acquaint
her
of
it
but
i
persuaded
them
if
they
loved
benedick
to
wish
him
wrestle
with
affection
and
never
to
let
beatrice
know
of
it
ursula
why
did
you
so
doth
not
the
gentleman
deserve
as
full
as
fortunate
a
bed
as
ever
beatrice
shall
couch
upon
hero
o
god
of
love
i
know
he
doth
deserve
as
much
as
may
be
yielded
to
a
man
but
nature
never
framed
a
woman
s
heart
of
prouder
stuff
than
that
of
beatrice
disdain
and
scorn
ride
sparkling
in
her
eyes
misprising
what
they
look
on
and
her
wit
values
itself
so
highly
that
to
her
all
matter
else
seems
weak
she
cannot
love
nor
take
no
shape
nor
project
of
affection
she
is
so
self
endeared
ursula
sure
i
think
so
and
therefore
certainly
it
were
not
good
she
knew
his
love
lest
she
make
sport
at
it
hero
why
you
speak
truth
i
never
yet
saw
man
how
wise
how
noble
young
how
rarely
featured
but
she
would
spell
him
backward
if
fair
faced
she
would
swear
the
gentleman
should
be
her
sister
if
black
why
nature
drawing
of
an
antique
made
a
foul
blot
if
tall
a
lance
ill
headed
if
low
an
agate
very
vilely
cut
if
speaking
why
a
vane
blown
with
all
winds
if
silent
why
a
block
moved
with
none
so
turns
she
every
man
the
wrong
side
out
and
never
gives
to
truth
and
virtue
that
which
simpleness
and
merit
purchaseth
ursula
sure
sure
such
carping
is
not
commendable
hero
no
not
to
be
so
odd
and
from
all
fashions
as
beatrice
is
cannot
be
commendable
but
who
dare
tell
her
so
if
i
should
speak
she
would
mock
me
into
air
o
she
would
laugh
me
out
of
myself
press
me
to
death
with
wit
therefore
let
benedick
like
cover
d
fire
consume
away
in
sighs
waste
inwardly
it
were
a
better
death
than
die
with
mocks
which
is
as
bad
as
die
with
tickling
ursula
yet
tell
her
of
it
hear
what
she
will
say
hero
no
rather
i
will
go
to
benedick
and
counsel
him
to
fight
against
his
passion
and
truly
i
ll
devise
some
honest
slanders
to
stain
my
cousin
with
one
doth
not
know
how
much
an
ill
word
may
empoison
liking
ursula
o
do
not
do
your
cousin
such
a
wrong
she
cannot
be
so
much
without
true
judgment
having
so
swift
and
excellent
a
wit
as
she
is
prized
to
have
as
to
refuse
so
rare
a
gentleman
as
signior
benedick

he
is
the
only
man
of
italy
always

great

hang
him
truant
there
s
no
true
drop
of
blood
in
him
to
be
truly
touched
with
love
if
he
be
sad
he
wants
money
benedick
i
have
the
toothache
don
pedro
draw
it
benedick
hang
it

you
must
hang
it
first
and
draw
it
afterwards
don
pedro
what
sigh
for
the
toothache
leonato
where
is
but
a
humour
or
a
worm
benedick
well
every
one
can
master
a
grief
but
he
that
has
it
claudio
yet
say
i
he
is
in
love
don
pedro
there
is
no
appearance
of
fancy
in
him
unless
it
be
a
fancy
that
he
hath
to
strange
disguises
as
to
be
a
dutchman
today
a
frenchman
to
morrow
or
in
the
shape
of
two
countries
at
once
as
a
german
from
the
waist
downward
all
slops
and
a
spaniard
from
the
hip
upward
no
doublet
unless
he
have
a
fancy
to
this
foolery
as
it
appears
he
hath
he
is
no
fool
for
fancy
as
you
would
have
it
appear
he
is
claudio
if
he
be
not
in
love
with
some
woman
there
is
no
believing
old
signs
a
brushes
his
hat
o
mornings
what
should
that
bode
don
pedro
hath
any
man
seen
him
at
the
barber
s
claudio
no
but
the
barber
s
man
hath
been
seen
with
him
and
the
old
ornament
of
his
cheek
hath
already
stuffed
tennis
balls
leonato
indeed
he
looks
younger
than
he
did
by
the
loss
of
a
beard
don
pedro
nay
a
rubs
himself
with
civet
can
you
smell
him
out
by
that
claudio
that
s
as
much
as
to
say
the
sweet
youth
s
in
love
don
pedro
the
greatest
note
of
it
is
his
melancholy
claudio
and
when
was
he
wont
to
wash
his
face
don
pedro
yea
or
to
paint
himself
for
the
which
i
hear
what
they
say
of
him
claudio
nay
but
his
jesting
spirit
which
is
now
crept
into
a
lute
string
and
now
governed
by
stops
don
pedro
indeed
that
tells
a
heavy
tale
for
him
conclude
conclude
he
is
in
love
claudio
nay
but
i
know
who
loves
him
don
pedro
that
would
i
know
too
i
warrant
one
that
knows
him
not
claudio
yes
and
his
ill
conditions
and
in
despite
of
all
dies
for
him
don
pedro
she
shall
be
buried
with
her
face
upwards
benedick
yet
is
this
no
charm
for
the
toothache
old
signior
walk
aside
with
me
i
have
studied
eight
or
nine
wise
words
to
speak
to
you
which
these
hobby
horses
must
not
hear
exeunt
benedick
and
leonato
don
pedro
for
my
life
to
break
with
him
about
beatrice
claudio
tis
even
so
hero
and
margaret
have
by
this
played
their
parts
with
beatrice
and
then
the
two
bears
will
not
bite
one
another
when
they
meet
enter
don
john
don
john
my
lord
and
brother
god
save
you
don
pedro

den
brother
don
john
if
your
leisure
served
i
would
speak
with
you
don
pedro
in
private
don
john
if
it
please
you
yet
count
claudio
may
hear
for
what
i
would
speak
of
concerns
him
don
pedro
what
s
the
matter
don
john
[to
claudio]
means
your
lordship
to
be
married
to
morrow
don
pedro
you
know
he
does
don
john
i
know
not
that
when
he
knows
what
i
know
claudio
if
there
be
any
impediment
i
pray
you
discover
it
don
john
you
may
think
i
love
you
not
let
that
appear
hereafter
and
aim
better
at
me
by
that
i
now
will
manifest
for
my
brother
i
think
he
holds
you
well
and
in
dearness
of
heart
hath
holp
to
effect
your
ensuing
marriage
surely
suit
ill
spent
and
labour
ill
bestowed
don
pedro
why
what
s
the
matter
don
john
i
came
hither
to
tell
you
and
circumstances
shortened
for
she
has
been
too
long
a
talking
of
the
lady
is
disloyal
claudio
who
hero
don
pedro
even
she
leonato
s
hero
your
hero
every
man
s
hero
claudio
disloyal
don
john
the
word
is
too
good
to
paint
out
her
wickedness
i
could
say
she
were
worse
think
you
of
a
worse
title
and
i
will
fit
her
to
it
wonder
not
till
further
warrant
go
but
with
me
to
night
you
shall
see
her
chamber
window
entered
even
the
night
before
her
wedding
day
if
you
love
her
then
to
morrow
wed
her
but
it
would
better
fit
your
honour
to
change
your
mind
claudio
may
this
be
so
don
pedro
i
will
not
think
it
don
john
if
you
dare
not
trust
that
you
see
confess
not
that
you
know
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
show
you
enough
and
when
you
have
seen
more
and
heard
more
proceed
accordingly
claudio
if
i
see
any
thing
to
night
why
i
should
not
marry
her
to
morrow
in
the
congregation
where
i
should
wed
there
will
i
shame
her
don
pedro
and
as
i
wooed
for
thee
to
obtain
her
i
will
join
with
thee
to
disgrace
her
don
john
i
will
disparage
her
no
farther
till
you
are
my
witnesses
bear
it
coldly
but
till
midnight
and
let
the
issue
show
itself
don
pedro
o
day
untowardly
turned
claudio
o
mischief
strangely
thwarting
don
john
o
plague
right
well
prevented
so
will
you
say
when
you
have
seen
the
sequel
exeunt
scene
iii
a
street
enter
dogberry
and
verges
with
the
watch
dogberry
are
you
good
men
and
true
verges
yea
or
else
it
were
pity
but
they
should
suffer
salvation
body
and
soul
dogberry
nay
that
were
a
punishment
too
good
for
them
if
they
should
have
any
allegiance
in
them
being
chosen
for
the
prince
s
watch
verges
well
give
them
their
charge
neighbour
dogberry
dogberry
first
who
think
you
the
most
desertless
man
to
be
constable
first
watchman
hugh
otecake
sir
or
george
seacole
for
they
can
write
and
read
dogberry
come
hither
neighbour
seacole
god
hath
blessed
you
with
a
good
name
to
be
a
well
favoured
man
is
the
gift
of
fortune
but
to
write
and
read
comes
by
nature
second
watchman
both
which
master
constable
dogberry
you
have
i
knew
it
would
be
your
answer
well
for
your
favour
sir
why
give
god
thanks
and
make
no
boast
of
it
and
for
your
writing
and
reading
let
that
appear
when
there
is
no
need
of
such
vanity
you
are
thought
here
to
be
the
most
senseless
and
fit
man
for
the
constable
of
the
watch
therefore
bear
you
the
lantern
this
is
your
charge
you
shall
comprehend
all
vagrom
men
you
are
to
bid
any
man
stand
in
the
prince
s
name
second
watchman
how
if
a
will
not
stand
dogberry
why
then
take
no
note
of
him
but
let
him
go
and
presently
call
the
rest
of
the
watch
together
and
thank
god
you
are
rid
of
a
knave
verges
if
he
will
not
stand
when
he
is
bidden
he
is
none
of
the
prince
s
subjects
dogberry
true
and
they
are
to
meddle
with
none
but
the
prince
s
subjects
you
shall
also
make
no
noise
in
the
streets
for
for
the
watch
to
babble
and
to
talk
is
most
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
watchman
we
will
rather
sleep
than
talk
we
know
what
belongs
to
a
watch
dogberry
why
you
speak
like
an
ancient
and
most
quiet
watchman
for
i
cannot
see
how
sleeping
should
offend
only
have
a
care
that
your
bills
be
not
stolen
well
you
are
to
call
at
all
the
ale
houses
and
bid
those
that
are
drunk
get
them
to
bed
watchman
how
if
they
will
not
dogberry
why
then
let
them
alone
till
they
are
sober
if
they
make
you
not
then
the
better
answer
you
may
say
they
are
not
the
men
you
took
them
for
watchman
well
sir
dogberry
if
you
meet
a
thief
you
may
suspect
him
by
virtue
of
your
office
to
be
no
true
man
and
for
such
kind
of
men
the
less
you
meddle
or
make
with
them
why
the
more
is
for
your
honesty
watchman
if
we
know
him
to
be
a
thief
shall
we
not
lay
hands
on
him
dogberry
truly
by
your
office
you
may
but
i
think
they
that
touch
pitch
will
be
defiled
the
most
peaceable
way
for
you
if
you
do
take
a
thief
is
to
let
him
show
himself
what
he
is
and
steal
out
of
your
company
verges
you
have
been
always
called
a
merciful
man
partner
dogberry
truly
i
would
not
hang
a
dog
by
my
will
much
more
a
man
who
hath
any
honesty
in
him
verges
if
you
hear
a
child
cry
in
the
night
you
must
call
to
the
nurse
and
bid
her
still
it
watchman
how
if
the
nurse
be
asleep
and
will
not
hear
us
dogberry
why
then
depart
in
peace
and
let
the
child
wake
her
with
crying
for
the
ewe
that
will
not
hear
her
lamb
when
it
baes
will
never
answer
a
calf
when
he
bleats
verges
tis
very
true
dogberry
this
is
the
end
of
the
charge
you
constable
are
to
present
the
prince
s
own
person
if
you
meet
the
prince
in
the
night
you
may
stay
him
verges
nay
by
r
our
lady
that
i
think
a
cannot
dogberry
five
shillings
to
one
on
t
with
any
man
that
knows
the
statutes
he
may
stay
him
marry
not
without
the
prince
be
willing
for
indeed
the
watch
ought
to
offend
no
man
and
it
is
an
offence
to
stay
a
man
against
his
will
verges
by
r
lady
i
think
it
be
so
dogberry
ha
ha
ha
well
masters

night

there
be
any
matter
of
weight
chances
call
up

answer
for

and
now
forward
with
thy

then
under
this

and
i
will
like

true
drunkard

all
to

some
treason
masters
yet
stand
close
borachio
therefore
know
i
have
earned
of
don
john
a
thousand
ducats
conrade
is
it
possible
that
any
villany
should
be
so
dear
borachio
thou
shouldst
rather
ask
if
it
were
possible
any
villany
should
be
so
rich
for
when
rich
villains
have
need
of
poor
ones
poor
ones
may
make
what
price
they
will
conrade
i
wonder
at
it
borachio
that
shows
thou
art
unconfirmed
thou
knowest
that
the
fashion
of
a
doublet
or
a
hat
or
a
cloak
is
nothing
to
a
man
conrade
yes
it
is
apparel
borachio
i
mean
the
fashion
conrade
yes
the
fashion
is
the
fashion
borachio
tush
i
may
as
well
say
the
fool
s
the
fool
but
seest
thou
not
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
watchman
[aside]
i
know
that
deformed
a
has
been
a
vile
thief
this
seven
year
a
goes
up
and
down
like
a
gentleman
i
remember
his
name
borachio
didst
thou
not
hear
somebody
conrade
no
twas
the
vane
on
the
house
borachio
seest
thou
not
i
say
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
how
giddily
a
turns
about
all
the
hot
bloods
between
fourteen
and
five
and
thirty
sometimes
fashioning
them
like
pharaoh
s
soldiers
in
the
reeky
painting
sometime
like
god
bel
s
priests
in
the
old
church
window
sometime
like
the
shaven
hercules
in
the
smirched
worm
eaten
tapestry
where
his
codpiece
seems
as
massy
as
his
club
conrade
all
this
i
see
and
i
see
that
the
fashion
wears
out
more
apparel
than
the
man
but
art
not
thou
thyself
giddy
with
the
fashion
too
that
thou
hast
shifted
out
of
thy
tale
into
telling
me
of
the
fashion
borachio
not
so
neither
but
know
that
i
have
to
night
wooed
margaret
the

amiable
encounter

two
of
them
did
the
prince
and
claudio
but
the
devil
my
master
knew
she
was
margaret
and
partly
by
his
oaths
which
first
possessed
them
partly
by
the
dark
night
which
did
deceive
them
but
chiefly
by
my
villany
which
did
confirm
any
slander
that
don
john
had
made
away
went
claudio
enraged
swore
he
would
meet
her
as

would
you
not
swear
all
you
that
see
her
that
she
were
a
maid
by
these
exterior
shows
but
she
is
none
she
knows
the
heat
of
a
luxurious

her
blush
is
guiltiness
not
modesty
leonato
what
do
you
mean
my

not
to
knit
my
soul

i
know
what
you

so
extenuate

to
me
as
dian

were

o
that
is
stronger
made
which

foulness
wash
d
it
with
tears
hence
from
her
let
her
die
friar
francis
hear
me
a
little
for
i
have
only
been
silent
so
long
and
given
way
unto
this
course
of
fortune
by
noting
of
the
lady
i
have
mark
d
a
thousand
blushing
apparitions
to
start
into
her
face
a
thousand
innocent
shames
in
angel
whiteness
beat
away
those
blushes
and
in
her
eye
there
hath
appear
d
a
fire
to
burn
the
errors
that
these
princes
hold
against
her
maiden
truth
call
me
a
fool
trust
not
my
reading
nor
my
observations
which
with

trust
not
my

if
this
sweet

not
guiltless
here
under
some
biting
error
leonato
friar
it
cannot
be
thou
seest
that
all
the
grace
that
she
hath
left
is
that
she
will
not
add
to
her
damnation
a
sin
of
perjury
she
not
denies
it
why
seek
st
thou
then
to
cover
with
excuse
that
which
appears
in
proper
nakedness
friar
francis
lady
what
man
is
he
you
are
accused
of

they
know

accuse
me
i

friar

there
is
some
strange
misprision
in
the
princes
benedick
two
of
them
have
the
very
bent
of
honour
and
if
their
wisdoms
be
misled
in
this
the
practise
of
it
lives
in
john
the
bastard
whose
spirits
toil
in
frame
of
villanies
leonato
i
know
not
if
they
speak
but
truth
of
her
these
hands
shall
tear
her
if
they
wrong
her
honour
the
proudest
of
them
shall
well
hear
of
it
time
hath
not
yet
so
dried
this
blood
of
mine
nor
age
so
eat
up
my
invention
nor
fortune
made
such
havoc
of
my
means
nor
my
bad
life
reft
me
so
much
of
friends
but
they
shall
find
awaked
in
such
a
kind
both
strength
of
limb
and
policy
of
mind
ability
in
means
and
choice
of
friends
to
quit
me
of
them
throughly
friar
francis
pause
awhile
and
let
my
counsel
sway
you
in
this
case
your
daughter
here
the
princes
left
for
dead
let
her
awhile
be
secretly
kept
in
and
publish
it
that
she
is
dead
indeed
maintain
a
mourning
ostentation
and
on
your
family
s
old
monument
hang
mournful
epitaphs
and
do
all
rites
that
appertain
unto
a
burial
leonato
what
shall
become
of
this
what
will
this
do
friar
francis
marry
this
well
carried
shall
on
her
behalf
change
slander
to
remorse
that
is
some
good
but
not
for
that
dream
i
on
this
strange
course
but
on
this
travail
look
for
greater
birth
she
dying
as
it
must
so
be
maintain
d
upon
the
instant
that
she
was
accused
shall
be
lamented
pitied
and
excused
of
every
hearer
for
it
so
falls
out
that
what
we
have
we
prize
not
to
the
worth
whiles
we
enjoy
it
but
being
lack
d
and
lost
why
then
we
rack
the
value
then
we
find
the
virtue
that
possession
would
not
show
us
whiles
it
was
ours
so
will
it
fare
with
claudio
when
he
shall
hear
she
died
upon
his
words
the
idea
of
her
life
shall
sweetly
creep
into
his
study
of
imagination
and
every
lovely
organ
of
her
life
shall
come
apparell
d
in
more
precious
habit
more
moving
delicate
and
full
of
life
into
the
eye
and
prospect
of
his
soul
than
when
she
lived
indeed
then
shall
he
mourn
if
ever
love
had
interest
in
his
liver
and
wish
he
had
not
so
accused
her
no
though
he
thought
his
accusation
true
let
this
be
so
and
doubt
not
but
success
will
fashion
the
event
in
better
shape
than
i
can
lay
it
down
in
likelihood
but
if
all
aim
but
this
be
levell
d
false
the
supposition
of
the
lady
s
death
will
quench
the
wonder
of
her
infamy
and
if
it
sort
not
well
you
may
conceal
her
as
best
befits
her
wounded
reputation
in
some
reclusive
and
religious
life
out
of
all
eyes
tongues
minds
and
injuries
benedick

if
you
go
on
thus
you
will
kill
yourself
and
tis
not
wisdom
thus
to
second
grief
against
yourself
leonato
i
pray
thee
cease
thy
counsel
which
falls
into
mine
ears
as
profitless
as
water
in
a
sieve
give
not
me
counsel
nor
let
no
comforter
delight
mine
ear
but
such
a
one
whose
wrongs
do
suit
with
mine
bring
me
a
father
that
so
loved
his
child
whose
joy
of
her
is
overwhelm
d
like
mine
and
bid
him
speak
of
patience
measure
his
woe
the
length
and
breadth
of
mine
and
let
it
answer
every
strain
for
strain
as
thus
for
thus
and
such
a
grief
for
such
in
every
lineament
branch
shape
and
form
if
such
a
one
will
smile
and
stroke
his
beard
bid
sorrow
wag
cry
hem
when
he
should
groan
patch
grief
with
proverbs
make
misfortune
drunk
with
candle
wasters
bring
him
yet
to
me
and
i
of
him
will
gather
patience
but
there
is
no
such
man
for
brother
men
can
counsel
and
speak
comfort
to
that
grief
which
they
themselves
not
feel
but
tasting
it
their
counsel
turns
to
passion
which
before
would
give
preceptial
medicine
to
rage
fetter
strong
madness
in
a
silken
thread
charm
ache
with
air
and
agony
with
words
no
no
tis
all
men
s
office
to
speak
patience
to
those
that
wring
under
the
load
of
sorrow
but
no
man
s
virtue
nor
sufficiency
to
be
so
moral
when
he
shall
endure
the
like
himself
therefore
give
me
no
counsel
my
griefs
cry
louder
than

a
giant
to

my
villany
they

upon

my
shame
the
lady

dead
upon
mine
and
my
master

false
accusation

in

but
in
loving
leander
the
good
swimmer
troilus
the
first
employer
of
panders
and
a
whole
bookful
of
these
quondam
carpet
mangers
whose
names
yet
run
smoothly
in
the
even
road
of
a
blank
verse
why
they
were
never
so
truly
turned
over
and
over
as
my
poor
self
in
love
marry
i
cannot
show
it
in
rhyme
i
have
tried
i
can
find
out
no
rhyme
to
lady
but
baby
an
innocent
rhyme
for
scorn
horn
a
hard
rhyme
for
school
fool
a
babbling
rhyme
very
ominous
endings
no
i
was
not
born
under
a
rhyming
planet
nor
i
cannot
woo
in
festival
terms
enter
beatrice
sweet
beatrice
wouldst
thou
come
when
i
called
thee
beatrice
yea
signior
and
depart
when
you
bid
me
benedick
o
stay
but
till
then
beatrice
then
is
spoken
fare
you
well
now
and
yet
ere
i
go
let
me
go
with
that
i
came
which
is
with
knowing
what
hath
passed
between
you
and
claudio
benedick
only
foul
words
and
thereupon
i
will
kiss
thee
beatrice
foul
words
is
but
foul
wind
and
foul
wind
is
but
foul
breath
and
foul
breath
is
noisome
therefore
i
will
depart
unkissed
benedick
thou
hast
frighted
the
word
out
of
his
right
sense
so
forcible
is
thy
wit
but
i
must
tell
thee
plainly
claudio
undergoes
my
challenge
and
either
i
must
shortly
hear
from
him
or
i
will
subscribe
him
a
coward
and
i
pray
thee
now
tell
me
for
which
of
my
bad
parts
didst
thou
first
fall
in
love
with
me
beatrice
for
them
all
together
which
maintained
so
politic
a
state
of
evil
that
they
will
not
admit
any
good
part
to
intermingle
with
them
but
for
which
of
my
good
parts
did
you
first
suffer
love
for
me
benedick
suffer
love
a
good
epithet
i
do
suffer
love
indeed
for
i
love
thee
against
my
will
beatrice
in
spite
of
your
heart
i
think
alas
poor
heart
if
you
spite
it
for
my
sake
i
will
spite
it
for
yours
for
i
will
never
love
that
which
my
friend
hates
benedick
thou
and
i
are
too
wise
to
woo
peaceably
beatrice
it
appears
not
in
this
confession
there
s
not
one
wise
man
among
twenty
that
will
praise
himself
benedick
an
old
an
old
instance
beatrice
that
lived
in
the
lime
of
good
neighbours
if
a
man
do
not
erect
in
this
age
his
own
tomb
ere
he
dies
he
shall
live
no
longer
in
monument
than
the
bell
rings
and
the
widow
weeps
beatrice
and
how
long
is
that
think
you
benedick
question
why
an
hour
in
clamour
and
a
quarter
in
rheum
therefore
is
it
most
expedient
for
the
wise
if
don
worm
his
conscience
find
no
impediment
to
the
contrary
to
be
the
trumpet
of
his
own
virtues
as
i
am
to

been
deceived
they
swore
you
did
beatrice
do
not
you
love
me
benedick
troth
no
no
more
than
reason
beatrice
why
then
my
cousin
margaret
and
ursula
are
much
deceived
for
they
did
swear
you
did
benedick
they
swore
that
you
were
almost
sick
for
me
beatrice
they
swore
that
you
were
well
nigh
dead
for
me
benedick
tis
no

matter
then

not
love
me
beatrice

truly
but
in
friendly
recompense
leonato
come
cousin
i
am
sure
you
love
the
gentleman
claudio
and
i
ll
be
sworn
upon
t
that
he
loves
her
for
here
s
a
paper
written
in
his
hand
a
halting
sonnet
of
his
own
pure
brain
fashion
d
to
beatrice
hero
and
here
s
another
writ
in
my
cousin
s
hand
stolen
from
her
pocket
containing
her
affection
unto
benedick
benedick
a
miracle
here
s
our
own
hands
against
our
hearts
come
i
will
have
thee
but
by
this
light
i
take
thee
for
pity
beatrice
i
would
not
deny
you
but
by
this
good
day
i
yield
upon
great
persuasion
and
partly
to
save
your
life
for
i
was
told
you
were
in
a
consumption
benedick
peace
i
will
stop
your
mouth
kissing
her
don
pedro
how
dost
thou
benedick
the
married
man
benedick
i
ll
tell
thee
what
prince
a
college
of
wit
crackers
cannot
flout
me
out
of
my
humour
dost
thou
think
i
care
for
a
satire
or
an
epigram

if
a
man
will
be
beaten

shall
wear
nothing
handsome
about
him
in
brief
since
i
do
purpose
to
marry
i
will
think
nothing
to
any
purpose
that
the
world
can
say
against
it
and
therefore
never
flout
at
me
for
what
i
have
said
against
it
for

is
a
giddy
thing
and
this
is
my
conclusion
for
thy
part
claudio

did
think
to
have
beaten
thee
but
in
that
thou
art
like
to
be
my
kinsman
live
unbruised
and
love
my
cousin
claudio
i
had
well
hoped
thou
wouldst
have
denied
beatrice
that
i
might
have
cudgelled
thee
out
of
thy
single
life
to
make
thee
a
double
dealer
which
out
of
question
thou
wilt
be
if
my

not
look
exceedingly
narrowly
to
thee
