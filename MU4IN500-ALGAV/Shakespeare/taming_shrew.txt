i
politicly
begun

empty
and
till
she
stoop
she
must
not
be
full
gorged
for
then
she
never
looks
upon
her
lure
another
way
i
have
to
man
my
haggard
to
make
her
come
and
know
her
keeper
s
call
that
is
to
watch
her
as
we
watch
these
kites
that
bate
and
beat
and
will
not
be
obedient
she
eat
no
meat
to
day
nor
none
shall
eat
last
night
she
slept
not
nor
to
night
she
shall
not
as
with
the
meat
some
undeserved
fault
i
ll
find
about
the
making
of
the
bed
and
here
i
ll
fling
the
pillow
there
the
bolster
this
way
the
coverlet
another
way
the
sheets
ay
and
amid
this
hurly
i
intend
that
all
is
done
in
reverend
care
of
her
and
in
conclusion
she
shall
watch
all
night
and
if
she
chance
to
nod
i
ll
rail
and
brawl
and
with
the
clamour
keep
her
still
awake
this
is
a
way
to
kill
a
wife
with
kindness
and
thus
i
ll
curb
her
mad
and
headstrong
humour
he
that
knows
better
how
to

as
one
unworthy
all
the
former
favours
that
i
have
fondly

and
here
i
take
the
unfeigned

would
entreat

how
beastly
she
doth
court
him

yet
and
show
more
sign
of
her
obedience
her
new
built
virtue
and
obedience

where
she
comes
and
brings
your
froward
wives
as
prisoners
to
her
womanly
persuasion
re
enter
katharina
with
bianca
and
widow
katharina
that
cap
of
yours
becomes
you
not
off
with
that
bauble
throw
it
under
foot
widow
lord
let
me
never
have
a
cause
to
sigh
till
i
be
brought
to
such
a
silly
pass
bianca
fie
what
a
foolish
duty
call
you
this
lucentio
i
would
your
duty
were
as
foolish
too
the
wisdom
of
your
duty
fair
bianca
hath
cost
me
an
hundred
crowns
since
supper
time
bianca
the
more
fool
you
for
laying
on
my
duty
petruchio
katharina
i
charge
thee
tell
these
headstrong
women
what
duty
they
do
owe
their
lords
and
husbands
widow
come
come
you
re
mocking
we
will
have
no
telling
petruchio
come
on
i
say
and
first
begin
with
her
widow
she
shall
not
petruchio
i
say
she
shall
and
first
begin
with
her
katharina
fie
fie
unknit
that
threatening
unkind
brow
and
dart
not
scornful
glances
from
those
eyes
to
wound
thy
lord
thy
king
thy
governor
it
blots
thy
beauty
as
frosts
do
bite
the
meads
confounds
thy
fame
as
whirlwinds
shake
fair
buds
and
in
no
sense
is
meet
or
amiable
a
woman
moved
is
like
a
fountain
troubled
muddy
ill
seeming
thick
bereft
of
beauty
and
while
it
is
so
none
so
dry
or
thirsty
will
deign
to
sip
or
touch
one
drop
of
it
thy
husband
is
thy
lord
thy
life
thy
keeper
thy
head
thy
sovereign
one
that
cares
for
thee
and
for
thy
maintenance
commits
his
body
to
painful
labour
both
by
sea
and
land
to
watch
the
night
in
storms
the
day
in
cold
whilst
thou
liest
warm
at
home
secure
and
safe
and
craves
no
other
tribute
at
thy
hands
but
love
fair
looks
and
true
obedience
too
little
payment
for
so
great
a
debt
such
duty
as
the
subject
owes
the
prince
even
such
a
woman
oweth
to
her
husband
and
when
she
is
froward
peevish
sullen
sour
and
not
obedient
to
his
honest
will
what
is
she
but
a
foul
contending
rebel
and
graceless
traitor
to
her
loving
lord
i
am
ashamed
that
women
are
so
simple
to
offer
war
where
they
should
kneel
for
peace
or
seek
for
rule
supremacy
and
sway
when
they
are
bound
to
serve
love
and
obey
why
are
our
bodies
soft
and
weak
and
smooth
unapt
to
toil
and
trouble
in
the
world
but
that
our
soft
conditions
and
our
hearts
should
well
agree
with
our
external
parts
come
come
you
froward
and
unable
worms
my
mind
hath
been
as
big
as
one
of
yours
my
heart
as
great
my
reason
haply
more
to
bandy
word
for
word
and
frown
for
frown
but
now
i
see
our
lances
are
but
straws
our
strength
as
weak
our
weakness
past
compare
that
seeming
to
be
most
which
we
indeed
least
are
then
vail
your
stomachs
for
it
is
no
boot
and
place
your
hands
below
your
husband
s
foot
in
token
of
which
duty
if
he
please
my
hand
is
ready
may
it
do
him
ease
petruchio
why
there
s
a
wench
come
on
and
kiss
me
kate
lucentio
well
go
thy
ways
old
lad
for
thou
shalt
ha
t
vincentio
tis
a
good
hearing
when
children
are
toward
lucentio
but
a
harsh
hearing
when
women
are
froward
petruchio
come
kate
we
ll
to
bed
we
three
are
married
but
you
two
are
sped
to
lucentio

won
the
wager
though
you
hit
the
white
and
being
a
winner
god

you
good
night

and
katharina
hortensio
now

ways
