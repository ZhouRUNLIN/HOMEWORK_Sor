upon
the
right
and
party
of
her

this
might
have
been
prevented

made
whole
with

easy
arguments

bloody
issue
arbitrate

our
strong

possession
much
more
than

it
must
go
wrong
with

a
gentleman
born

that
the
elder

bastard
most
certain
of
one
mother
mighty

father

the
certain
knowledge
of

pops

five
hundred
pound
a
year

good
blunt

why

he
lay
claim
to
thine
inheritance
bastard
i
know
not
why
except
to
get
the
land
but
once
he
slander
d
me
with
bastardy
but
whether
i
be
as
true
begot
or
no
that
still
i
lay
upon
my
mother
s
head
but
that
i
am
as
well
begot
my
liege
fair
fall

bones
that
took

pains

like
him
o
old
sir
robert
father
on
my
knee
i
give
heaven
thanks

not
like
to
thee
king

why
what
a
madcap
hath
heaven
lent

here
queen
elinor
he
hath
a
trick
of
coeur
de
lion
s
face
the
accent
of
his
tongue
affecteth
him
do
you
not
read
some
tokens
of
my
son
in
the
large
composition
of
this
man
king
john
mine
eye
hath
well
examined
his
parts
and
finds
them
perfect
richard
sirrah
speak
what
doth
move
you
to
claim
your
brother
s
land
bastard
because
he
hath
a
half
face
like
my
father
with
half
that
face
would
he
have
all
my
land
a
half
faced
groat
five
hundred
pound
a
year
robert
my
gracious
liege
when
that
my
father
lived
your
brother
did
employ
my
father
much
bastard
well
sir
by
this
you
cannot
get
my
land
your
tale
must
be
how
he
employ
d
my
mother
robert
and
once
dispatch
d
him
in
an
embassy
to
germany
there
with
the
emperor
to
treat
of
high
affairs
touching
that
time
the
advantage
of
his
absence
took
the
king
and
in
the
mean
time
sojourn
d
at
my
father
s
where
how
he
did
prevail
i
shame
to
speak
but
truth
is
truth
large
lengths
of
seas
and
shores
between
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
as
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
himself
when
this
same
lusty
gentleman
was
got
upon
his
death
bed
he
by
will
bequeath
d
his
lands
to
me
and
took
it
on
his
death
that
this
my
mother
s
son
was
none
of
his
and
if
he
were
he
came
into
the
world
full
fourteen
weeks
before
the
course
of
time
then
good
my
liege
let
me
have
what
is
mine
my
father
s
land
as
was
my
father
s
will
king
john
sirrah
your
brother
is
legitimate
your
father
s
wife
did
after
wedlock
bear
him
and
if
she
did
play
false
the
fault
was
hers
which
fault
lies
on
the
hazards
of
all
husbands
that
marry
wives
tell
me
how
if
my
brother
who
as
you
say
took
pains
to
get
this
son
had
of
your
father
claim
d
this
son
for
his
in
sooth
good
friend
your
father
might
have
kept
this
calf
bred
from
his
cow
from
all
the
world
in
sooth
he
might
then
if
he
were
my
brother
s
my
brother
might
not
claim
him
nor
your
father
being
none
of
his
refuse
him
this
concludes
my
mother
s
son
did
get
your
father
s
heir
your
father
s
heir
must
have
your
father
s
land
robert
shall
then
my
father
s
will
be
of
no
force
to
dispossess
that
child
which
is
not
his
bastard
of
no
more
force
to
dispossess
me
sir
than
was
his
will
to
get
me
as
i
think
queen
elinor
whether
hadst
thou
rather
be
a
faulconbridge

like
thy
brother

the
reputed

of
coeur
de
lion
lord
of
thy

lady

niece
to

look
upon
the
years
of
lewis
the
dauphin
and
that
lovely
maid
if
lusty
love
should
go
in
quest
of
beauty
where
should
he
find
it
fairer
than
in
blanch
if
zealous
love
should
go
in
search
of
virtue
where
should
he
find
it
purer
than
in
blanch
if
love
ambitious
sought
a
match
of
birth
whose
veins
bound
richer
blood
than
lady
blanch
such
as
she
is
in
beauty
virtue
birth
is
the
young
dauphin
every
way
complete
if
not
complete
of
say
he
is
not
she
and
she
again
wants
nothing
to
name
want
if
want
it
be
not
that
she
is
not
he
he
is
the
half
part
of
a
blessed
man
left
to
be
finished
by
such
as
she
and
she
a
fair
divided
excellence
whose
fulness
of
perfection
lies
in
him
o
two
such
silver
currents
when
they
join
do
glorify
the
banks
that
bound
them
in
and
two
such
shores
to
two
such
streams
made
one
two
such
controlling
bounds
shall
you
be
kings
to
these
two
princes
if
you
marry
them
this
union
shall
do
more
than
battery
can
to
our
fast
closed
gates
for
at
this
match
with
swifter
spleen
than
powder
can
enforce
the
mouth
of
passage
shall
we
fling
wide
ope
and
give
you
entrance
but
without
this
match
the
sea
enraged
is
not
half
so
deaf
lions
more
confident
mountains

rocks
more
free
from
motion
no
not

moral
fury
half
so
peremptory

this
city
bastard

a
stay
that
shakes
the
rotten
carcass
of
old
death
out
of

that

except
this

shall
gild

say
st
thou
boy
look
in
the
lady

face
lewis

do
my
lord
and
in

eye
i
find
a
wonder
or
a
wondrous
miracle
the
shadow
of
myself
form
d
in
her
eye
which
being
but
the
shadow
of
your
son
becomes
a
sun
and
makes
your
son
a
shadow
i
do
protest
i
never
loved
myself
till
now
infixed
i
beheld
myself
drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
whispers
with
blanch
bastard
drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
hang
d
in
the
frowning
wrinkle
of
her
brow
and
quarter
d
in
her
heart
he
doth
espy
himself
love
s
traitor
this
is
pity
now
that

and
drawn
and
quartered
there
should
be
in
such
a
love
so
vile
a
lout
as
he
blanch
my
uncle

will
in
this
respect
is
mine
if
he
see
aught
in
you
that
makes
him
like
that
any
thing
he
sees
which
moves
his
liking
i
can
with
ease
translate
it
to
my
will
or
if
you
will
to
speak
more
properly
i
will
enforce
it
easily
to
my
love
further
i
will
not
flatter
you
my
lord
that
all
i
see
in
you
is
worthy
love
than
this
that
nothing
do
i
see
in
you
though
churlish
thoughts
themselves
should
be
your
judge
that
i
can
find
should
merit
any
hate
king
john
what
say
these
young

what
say
you
my

that
she
is
bound
in

still
to

in
wisdom
still
vouchsafe
to
say

cardinal
pandulph
hail
you
anointed
deputies
of

to
thee
king
john
my
holy
errand
is
i
pandulph
of
fair
milan
cardinal
and
from
pope
innocent
the
legate
here
do
in
his
name
religiously
demand
why
thou
against
the
church
our
holy
mother
so
wilfully
dost
spurn
and
force
perforce
keep
stephen
langton
chosen
archbishop
of
canterbury
from
that
holy
see
this
in
our
foresaid
holy
father
s
name
pope
innocent
i
do
demand
of
thee
king
john
what
earthy
name
to
interrogatories
can
task
the
free
breath
of
a
sacred
king
thou
canst
not
cardinal
devise
a
name
so
slight
unworthy
and
ridiculous
to
charge
me
to
an
answer
as
the
pope
tell
him
this
tale
and
from
the
mouth
of
england
add
thus
much
more
that
no
italian
priest
shall
tithe
or
toll
in
our
dominions
but
as
we
under
heaven
are
supreme
head
so
under
him
that
great
supremacy
where
we
do
reign
we
will
alone
uphold
without
the
assistance
of
a
mortal
hand
so
tell
the
pope
all
reverence
set
apart
to
him
and
his
usurp
d
authority
king
philip
brother
of
england
you
blaspheme
in
this
king
john
though
you
and
all
the
kings
of
christendom
are
led
so
grossly
by
this
meddling
priest
dreading
the
curse
that
money
may
buy
out
and
by
the
merit
of
vile
gold
dross
dust
purchase
corrupted
pardon
of
a
man
who
in
that
sale
sells
pardon
from
himself
though
you
and
all
the
rest
so
grossly
led
this
juggling
witchcraft
with
revenue
cherish
yet
i
alone
alone
do
me
oppose
against
the
pope
and
count
his
friends
my
foes
cardinal
pandulph
then
by
the
lawful
power
that
i
have
thou
shalt
stand
cursed
and
excommunicate
and
blessed
shall
he
be
that
doth
revolt
from
his
allegiance
to
an
heretic
and
meritorious
shall
that
hand
be
call
d
canonized
and
worshipped
as
a
saint
that
takes
away
by
any
secret
course
thy
hateful
life
constance
o
lawful
let
it
be
that
i
have
room
with
rome
to
curse
awhile
good
father
cardinal
cry
thou
amen
to
my
keen
curses
for

my

bar
no

law
cannot
give
my
child
his
kingdom
here
for
he
that
holds
his
kingdom
holds
the
law
therefore
since
law
itself
is
perfect
wrong
how
can
the
law
forbid
my
tongue
to
curse
cardinal
pandulph
philip
of
france
on
peril
of
a
curse
let
go
the

if

good
reverend
father
make
my
person
yours
and
tell
me
how
you
would
bestow
yourself
this
royal
hand
and
mine
are
newly
knit
and
the
conjunction
of
our
inward
souls
married
in
league
coupled
and
linked
together
with
all
religious
strength
of
sacred
vows
the
latest
breath
that
gave
the
sound
of
words
was
deep
sworn
faith
peace
amity
true
love
between
our
kingdoms
and
our
royal
selves
and
even
before
this
truce
but
new
before
no
longer
than
we
well
could
wash
our
hands
to
clap
this
royal
bargain
up
of
peace
heaven
knows
they
were
besmear
d
and
over
stain
d
with
slaughter
s
pencil
where
revenge
did
paint
the
fearful
difference
of
incensed
kings
and
shall
these
hands
so
lately
purged
of
blood
so
newly
join
d
in
love
so
strong
in
both
unyoke
this
seizure
and
this
kind
regreet
play
fast
and
loose
with
faith
so
jest
with
heaven
make
such
unconstant
children
of
ourselves
as
now
again
to
snatch
our
palm
from
palm
unswear
faith
sworn
and
on
the
marriage
bed
of
smiling
peace
to
march
a
bloody
host
and
make
a
riot
on
the
gentle
brow
of
true
sincerity
o
holy
sir
my
reverend
father
let
it
not
be
so
out
of
your
grace
devise
ordain
impose
some
gentle
order
and
then
we
shall
be
blest
to
do
your
pleasure
and
continue
friends
cardinal
pandulph
all

is
formless
order
orderless
save
what
is
opposite
to
england
s
love
therefore
to
arms
be
champion
of
our
church
or
let
the
church
our
mother
breathe
her
curse
a
mother
s
curse
on
her
revolting
son
france
thou
mayst
hold
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
a
chafed
lion
by
the
mortal
paw
a
fasting
tiger
safer
by
the
tooth
than
keep
in
peace
that
hand
which
thou
dost
hold
king
philip
i
may
disjoin
my
hand
but
not
my
faith
cardinal
pandulph
so
makest
thou
faith
an
enemy
to
faith
and
like
a
civil
war
set
st
oath
to
oath
thy
tongue
against
thy
tongue
o
let
thy
vow
first
made
to
heaven
first
be
to
heaven
perform
d
that
is
to
be
the
champion
of
our
church
what
since
thou
sworest
is
sworn
against
thyself
and
may
not
be
performed
by
thyself
for
that
which
thou
hast
sworn
to
do
amiss
is
not
amiss
when
it
is
truly
done
and
being
not
done
where
doing
tends
to
ill
the
truth
is
then
most
done
not
doing
it
the
better
act
of
purposes
mistook
is
to
mistake
again
though
indirect
yet
indirection
thereby
grows
direct
and
falsehood
falsehood
cures
as
fire
cools
fire
within
the
scorched
veins
of
one
new
burn
d
it
is
religion
that
doth
make
vows
kept
but
thou
hast
sworn
against
religion
by
what
thou
swear
st
against
the
thing
thou
swear
st
and
makest
an
oath
the
surety
for
thy
truth
against
an
oath
the
truth
thou
art
unsure
to
swear
swears
only
not
to
be
forsworn
else
what
a
mockery
should
it
be
to
swear
but
thou
dost
swear
only
to
be
forsworn
and
most
forsworn
to
keep
what
thou
dost
swear
therefore
thy
later
vows
against
thy
first
is
in
thyself
rebellion
to
thyself
and
better
conquest
never
canst
thou
make
than
arm
thy
constant
and
thy
nobler
parts
against
these
giddy
loose
suggestions
upon
which
better
part
our
prayers
come
in
if
thou
vouchsafe
them
but
if
not
then
know
the
peril
of
our
curses
light
on
thee
so
heavy
as
thou
shalt
not
shake
them
off
but
in
despair
die
under
their
black
weight

come
hither
little
kinsman
hark
a
word
king
john
come
hither
hubert
o
my
gentle
hubert
we
owe
thee
much
within
this
wall
of
flesh
there
is
a
soul
counts
thee
her
creditor
and
with
advantage
means
to
pay
thy
love
and
my
good
friend
thy
voluntary
oath
lives
in
this
bosom
dearly
cherished
give
me
thy
hand
i
had
a
thing
to
say
but
i
will
fit
it
with
some
better
time
by
heaven
hubert
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
what
good
respect
i
have
of
thee
hubert
i
am
much
bounden
to
your
majesty
king
john
good
friend
thou
hast
no
cause
to
say
so
yet
but
thou
shalt
have
and
creep
time
ne
er
so
slow
yet
it
shall
come
from
me
to
do
thee
good
i
had
a
thing
to
say
but
let
it
go
the
sun
is
in
the
heaven
and
the
proud
day
attended
with
the
pleasures
of
the
world
is
all
too
wanton
and
too
full
of
gawds
to
give
me
audience
if
the
midnight
bell
did
with
his
iron
tongue
and
brazen
mouth
sound
on
into
the
drowsy
race
of
night
if
this
same
were
a
churchyard
where
we
stand
and
thou
possessed
with
a
thousand
wrongs
or
if
that
surly
spirit
melancholy
had
baked
thy
blood
and
made
it
heavy
thick
which
else
runs
tickling
up
and
down
the
veins
making
that
idiot
laughter
keep
men
s
eyes
and
strain
their
cheeks
to
idle
merriment
a
passion
hateful
to
my
purposes
or
if
that
thou
couldst
see
me
without
eyes
hear
me
without
thine
ears
and
make
reply
without
a
tongue
using
conceit
alone
without
eyes
ears
and
harmful
sound
of
words
then
in
despite
of
brooded
watchful
day
i
would
into
thy
bosom
pour
my
thoughts
but
ah
i
will
not
yet
i
love
thee
well
and
by
my
troth
i
think
thou
lovest
me
well
hubert
so
well
that
what
you
bid
me
undertake
though
that
my
death
were
adjunct
to
my
act
by

do
it

shake

and
rouse
from

that
fell
anatomy
which
cannot
hear
a

which
scorns
a

invocation
cardinal

lady
you
utter
madness
and
not
sorrow
constance
thou
art
not
holy
to
belie
me
so
i
am
not
mad
this
hair
i
tear
is
mine
my
name
is
constance
i
was
geffrey
s
wife
young
arthur
is
my
son
and
he
is
lost
i
am
not
mad
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
for
then
tis
like
i
should
forget
myself
o
if
i
could
what
grief
should
i
forget
preach
some
philosophy
to
make
me
mad
and
thou
shalt
be
canonized
cardinal
for
being
not
mad
but
sensible
of
grief
my
reasonable
part
produces
reason
how
i
may
be
deliver
d
of
these
woes
and
teaches
me
to
kill
or
hang
myself
if
i
were
mad
i
should
forget
my
son
or
madly
think
a
babe
of
clouts
were
he
i
am
not
mad
too
well
too
well
i
feel
the
different
plague
of
each
calamity
king
philip
bind
up
those
tresses
o
what
love
i
note
in
the
fair
multitude
of
those
her
hairs
where
but
by
chance
a
silver
drop
hath
fallen
even
to
that
drop
ten
thousand
wiry
friends
do
glue
themselves
in
sociable
grief
like
true
inseparable
faithful
loves
sticking
together
in
calamity
constance
to
england
if
you
will
king
philip
bind
up
your
hairs
constance
yes
that
i
will
and
wherefore
will
i
do
it
i
tore
them
from
their
bonds
and
cried
aloud
o
that
these
hands
could
so
redeem
my
son
as
they
have
given
these
hairs
their
liberty
but
now
i
envy
at
their
liberty
and
will
again
commit
them
to
their
bonds
because
my
poor
child
is
a
prisoner
and
father
cardinal
i
have
heard
you
say
that
we
shall
see
and
know
our
friends
in
heaven
if
that
be
true
i
shall
see
my
boy
again
for
since
the
birth
of
cain
the
first
male
child
to
him
that
did
but
yesterday
suspire
there
was
not
such
a
gracious
creature
born
but
now
will
canker
sorrow
eat
my
bud
and
chase
the
native
beauty
from
his
cheek
and
he
will
look
as
hollow
as
a
ghost
as
dim
and
meagre
as
an
ague
s
fit
and
so
he
ll
die
and
rising
so
again
when
i
shall
meet
him
in
the
court
of
heaven
i
shall
not
know
him
therefore
never
never
must
i
behold
my
pretty
arthur
more
cardinal
pandulph
you
hold
too
heinous
a
respect
of
grief
constance
he
talks
to
me
that
never
had
a
son
king
philip
you
are
as
fond
of
grief
as
of
your
child
constance
grief
fills
the
room
up
of
my
absent
child
lies
in
his
bed
walks
up
and
down
with
me
puts
on
his
pretty
looks
repeats
his
words
remembers
me
of
all
his
gracious
parts
stuffs
out
his
vacant
garments
with
his
form
then
have
i
reason
to
be
fond
of
grief
fare
you
well
had
you
such
a
loss
as
i
i
could
give
better
comfort
than
you
do
i
will
not
keep
this
form
upon
my
head
when
there
is
such
disorder
in
my
wit
o
lord
my
boy
my
arthur
my
fair
son
my
life
my
joy
my
food
my
all
the
world
my
widow
comfort
and
my
sorrows
cure
exit
king
philip
i
fear
some
outrage
and
i
ll
follow
her
exit
lewis
there
s
nothing
in
this
world
can
make
me
joy
life
is
as
tedious
as
a
twice
told
tale
vexing
the
dull
ear
of
a
drowsy
man
and
bitter
shame
hath
spoil
d
the
sweet
world
s
taste
that
it
yields
nought
but
shame
and
bitterness
cardinal
pandulph
before
the
curing
of
a
strong
disease
even
in
the
instant
of
repair
and
health
the
fit
is
strongest
evils
that
take
leave
on
their
departure
most
of
all
show
evil
what
have
you
lost
by
losing
of
this
day
lewis
all
days
of
glory
joy
and
happiness
cardinal
pandulph
if
you
had
won
it
certainly
you
had
no
no
when
fortune
means
to
men
most
good
she
looks
upon
them
with
a
threatening
eye
tis
strange
to
think
how
much
king
john
hath
lost
in
this
which
he
accounts
so
clearly
won
are
not
you
grieved
that
arthur
is
his
prisoner
lewis
as
heartily
as
he
is
glad
he
hath
him
cardinal
pandulph
your
mind
is
all
as
youthful
as
your
blood
now
hear
me
speak
with
a
prophetic
spirit
for
even
the
breath
of
what
i
mean
to
speak
shall
blow
each
dust
each
straw
each
little
rub
out
of
the
path
which
shall
directly
lead
thy
foot
to
england
s
throne
and
therefore
mark
john
hath
seized
arthur
and
it
cannot
be
that
whiles
warm
life
plays
in
that
infant
s
veins
the
misplaced
john
should
entertain
an
hour
one
minute
nay
one
quiet
breath
of
rest
a
sceptre
snatch
d
with
an
unruly
hand
must
be
as
boisterously
maintain
d
as
gain
d
and
he
that
stands
upon
a
slippery
place
makes
nice
of
no
vile
hold
to
stay
him
up
that
john
may
stand
then
arthur
needs
must
fall
so
be
it
for
it
cannot
be
but
so
lewis
but
what
shall
i
gain
by
young
arthur
s
fall
cardinal
pandulph
you
in
the
right
of
lady
blanch
your
wife
may
then
make
all
the
claim
that
arthur
did
lewis
and
lose
it
life
and
all
as
arthur
did
cardinal
pandulph
how
green
you
are
and
fresh
in
this
old
world
john
lays
you
plots
the
times
conspire
with
you
for
he
that
steeps
his
safety
in
true
blood
shall
find
but
bloody
safety
and
untrue
this
act
so
evilly
born
shall
cool
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
and
freeze
up
their
zeal
that
none
so
small
advantage
shall
step
forth
to
cheque
his
reign
but
they
will
cherish
it
no
natural
exhalation
in
the
sky
no
scope
of
nature
no
distemper
d
day
no
common
wind
no
customed
event
but
they
will
pluck
away
his
natural
cause
and
call
them
meteors
prodigies
and
signs
abortives
presages
and
tongues
of
heaven
plainly
denouncing
vengeance
upon
john
lewis
may
be
he
will
not
touch
young
arthur
s
life
but
hold
himself
safe
in
his
prisonment
cardinal
pandulph
o
sir
when
he
shall
hear
of
your
approach
if
that
young
arthur
be
not
gone
already
even
at
that
news
he
dies
and
then
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
shall
revolt
from
him
and
kiss
the
lips
of
unacquainted
change
and
pick
strong
matter
of
revolt
and
wrath
out
of
the
bloody
fingers
ends
of
john
methinks
i
see
this
hurly
all
on
foot
and
o
what
better
matter
breeds
for
you
than
i
have
named
the
bastard
faulconbridge
is
now
in
england
ransacking
the
church
offending
charity
if
but
a
dozen
french
were
there
in
arms
they
would
be
as
a
call
to
train
ten
thousand
english
to
their
side
or
as
a
little
snow
tumbled
about
anon
becomes
a
mountain
o
noble
dauphin
go
with
me
to
the
king
tis
wonderful
what
may
be
wrought
out
of
their
discontent
now
that
their
souls
are
topful
of
offence
for
england
go
i
will
whet
on
the
king
lewis
strong
reasons
make
strong
actions
let
us
go
if
you
say
ay
the
king
will
not
say
no
exeunt
act
iv
scene
i
a
room
in
a
castle
enter
hubert
and
executioners
hubert
heat
me
these
irons
hot
and
look
thou
stand
within
the
arras
when
i
strike
my
foot
upon
the
bosom
of
the
ground
rush
forth
and
bind
the
boy
which
you
shall
find
with
me
fast
to
the
chair
be
heedful
hence
and
watch
first
executioner
i
hope
your
warrant
will
bear
out
the
deed
hubert
uncleanly
scruples
fear
not
you
look
to

young
lad
come
forth
i
have
to
say
with
you

arthur
arthur
good
morrow
hubert
hubert
good
morrow
little
prince
arthur
as
little
prince
having
so
great
a
title
to
be
more
prince
as
may
be
you
are
sad
hubert
indeed
i
have
been
merrier
arthur
mercy
on
me
methinks
no
body
should
be
sad
but
i
yet
i
remember
when
i
was
in
france
young
gentlemen
would
be
as
sad
as
night
only
for
wantonness
by
my
christendom
so
i
were
out
of
prison
and
kept
sheep
i
should
be
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
and
so
i
would
be
here
but
that
i
doubt
my
uncle
practises
more
harm
to
me
he
is
afraid
of
me
and
i
of
him
is
it
my
fault
that
i
was
geffrey
s
son
no
indeed
is
t
not
and
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
your
son
so
you
would
love
me
hubert
hubert
[aside]
if
i
talk
to
him
with
his
innocent
prate
he
will
awake
my
mercy
which
lies
dead
therefore
i
will
be
sudden
and
dispatch
arthur
are
you
sick
hubert
you
look
pale
to
day
in
sooth
i
would
you
were
a
little
sick
that
i
might
sit
all
night
and
watch
with
you
i
warrant
i
love
you
more
than
you
do
me
hubert
[aside]
his
words
do
take
possession
of
my
bosom
read
here
young
arthur
showing
a
paper
aside
how
now
foolish
rheum
turning
dispiteous
torture
out
of
door
i
must
be
brief
lest
resolution
drop
out
at
mine
eyes
in
tender
womanish
tears
can
you
not
read
it
is
it
not
fair
writ
arthur
too
fairly
hubert
for
so
foul
effect
must
you
with
hot
irons
burn
out
both
mine
eyes
hubert
young
boy
i
must
arthur
and
will
you
hubert
and
i
will
arthur
have
you
the
heart
when
your
head
did
but
ache
i
knit
my
handercher
about
your
brows
the
best
i
had
a
princess
wrought
it
me
and
i
did
never
ask
it
you
again
and
with
my
hand
at
midnight
held
your
head
and
like
the
watchful
minutes
to
the
hour
still
and
anon
cheer
d
up
the
heavy
time
saying
what
lack
you
and
where
lies
your
grief
or
what
good
love
may
i
perform
for
you
many
a
poor
man
s
son
would
have
lien
still
and
ne
er
have
spoke
a
loving
word
to
you
but
you
at
your
sick
service
had
a
prince
nay
you
may
think
my
love
was
crafty
love
and
call
it
cunning
do
an
if
you
will
if
heaven
be
pleased
that
you
must
use
me
ill
why
then
you
must
will
you
put
out
mine
eyes
these
eyes
that
never
did
nor
never
shall
so
much
as
frown
on
you
hubert
i
have
sworn
to
do
it
and
with
hot
irons
must
i
burn
them
out
arthur
ah
none
but
in
this
iron
age
would
do
it
the
iron
of
itself
though
heat

but
to
lose
your

there
were
but
a
mote
in
yours
a
grain
a
dust
a
gnat
a
wandering
hair
any
annoyance
in
that
precious
sense
then
feeling
what
small
things
are
boisterous
there
your
vile
intent
must
needs
seem
horrible
hubert
is
this
your
promise
go
to
hold
your
tongue
arthur
hubert
the
utterance
of
a
brace
of
tongues
must
needs
want
pleading
for
a
pair
of
eyes
let
me
not
hold
my
tongue
let
me
not
hubert
or
hubert
if
you
will
cut
out
my
tongue
so
i
may
keep
mine
eyes
o
spare
mine
eyes
though
to
no
use
but
still
to
look
on
you
lo
by
my
truth
the
instrument
is
cold
and
would
not
harm
me
hubert
i
can
heat
it
boy
arthur
no
in
good
sooth
the
fire
is
dead
with
grief
being
create
for
comfort
to
be
used
in
undeserved
extremes
see
else
yourself
there
is
no
malice
in
this
burning
coal
the
breath
of
heaven
has
blown
his
spirit
out
and
strew
d
repentent
ashes
on
his
head
hubert
but
with
my
breath
i
can
revive
it
boy
arthur
an
if
you
do
you
will
but
make
it
blush
and
glow
with
shame
of
your
proceedings
hubert
nay
it
perchance
will
sparkle
in
your
eyes
and
like
a
dog
that
is
compell
d
to
fight
snatch
at
his
master
that
doth
tarre
him
on
all
things
that
you
should
use
to
do
me
wrong
deny
their
office
only
you
do
lack
that
mercy
which
fierce
fire
and
iron
extends
creatures
of
note
for
mercy
lacking
uses
hubert
well
see
to
live
i
will
not
touch
thine
eye
for
all
the
treasure
that
thine
uncle
owes
yet

i
sworn
and
i
did
purpose
boy
with
this
same
very
iron
to
burn
them
out
arthur
o
now

look
like
hubert
all
this
while
you
were
disguised
hubert
peace
no
more
adieu
your
uncle
must
not
know
but
you
are
dead
i
ll
fill
these
dogged
spies
with
false
reports
and
pretty
child

doubtless
and
secure
that
hubert
for
the
wealth
of
all
the
world
will
not
offend
thee
arthur
o

i
thank
you
hubert
hubert

no
more
go
closely
in
with
me
much
danger
do
i
undergo
for
thee
exeunt
scene
ii
king
john
s
palace
enter
king
john
pembroke
salisbury
and
other
lords
king
john
here
once
again
we
sit
once
again
crown
d
and
looked
upon
i
hope
with
cheerful
eyes
pembroke
this
once
again
but
that
your
highness
pleased
was
once
superfluous
you
were
crown
d
before
and
that
high
royalty
was
ne
er
pluck
d
off
the
faiths
of
men
ne
er
stained
with
revolt
fresh
expectation
troubled
not
the
land
with
any
long
d
for
change
or
better
state
salisbury
therefore
to
be
possess
d
with
double
pomp
to
guard
a
title
that
was
rich
before
to
gild
refined
gold
to
paint
the
lily
to
throw
a
perfume
on
the
violet
to
smooth
the
ice
or
add
another
hue
unto
the
rainbow
or
with
taper
light
to
seek
the
beauteous
eye
of
heaven
to
garnish
is
wasteful
and
ridiculous
excess
pembroke
but
that
your
royal
pleasure
must
be
done
this
act
is
as
an
ancient
tale
new
told
and
in
the
last
repeating
troublesome
being
urged
at
a
time
unseasonable
salisbury
in
this
the
antique
and
well
noted
face
of
plain
old
form
is
much
disfigured
and
like
a
shifted
wind
unto
a
sail
it
makes
the
course
of
thoughts
to
fetch
about
startles
and
frights
consideration
makes
sound
opinion
sick
and
truth
suspected
for
putting
on
so
new
a
fashion
d
robe
pembroke
when
workmen
strive
to
do
better
than
well
they
do
confound
their
skill
in
covetousness
and
oftentimes
excusing
of
a
fault
doth
make
the
fault
the
worse
by
the
excuse
as
patches
set
upon
a
little
breach
discredit
more
in
hiding
of
the
fault
than
did
the
fault
before
it
was
so
patch
d
salisbury
to
this
effect
before
you
were
new
crown
d
we
breathed
our
counsel
but
it
pleased
your
highness
to
overbear
it
and
we
are
all
well
pleased
since
all
and
every
part
of
what
we
would
doth
make
a
stand
at
what
your
highness
will
king
john
some
reasons
of
this
double
coronation
i
have
possess
d
you
with
and
think
them
strong
and
more
more
strong
then
lesser
is
my
fear
i
shall
indue
you
with
meantime
but
ask
what
you
would
have
reform
d
that
is
not
well
and
well
shall
you
perceive
how
willingly
i
will
both
hear
and
grant
you
your
requests
pembroke
then
i
as
one
that
am
the
tongue
of
these
to
sound
the
purpose
of
all
their
hearts
both
for
myself
and
them
but
chief
of
all
your
safety
for
the
which
myself
and
them
bend
their
best
studies
heartily
request
the
enfranchisement
of
arthur
whose
restraint
doth
move
the
murmuring
lips
of
discontent
to
break
into
this
dangerous
argument
if
what
in
rest
you
have
in
right
you
hold
why
then
your
fears
which
as
they
say
attend
the
steps
of
wrong
should
move
you
to
mew
up
your
tender
kinsman
and
to
choke
his
days
with
barbarous
ignorance
and
deny
his
youth
the
rich
advantage
of
good
exercise
that
the
time
s
enemies
may
not
have
this
to
grace
occasions
let
it
be
our
suit
that
you
have
bid
us
ask
his
liberty
which
for
our
goods
we
do
no
further
ask
than
whereupon
our
weal
on
you
depending
counts
it
your
weal
he
have
his
liberty
enter
hubert
king
john
let
it
be
so
i
do
commit
his
youth
to
your
direction
hubert
what
news
with
you
taking
him
apart
pembroke
this
is
the
man
should
do
the
bloody
deed
he
show
d
his
warrant
to
a
friend
of
mine
the
image
of
a
wicked
heinous
fault
lives
in
his
eye
that
close
aspect
of
his
does
show
the
mood
of
a
much
troubled
breast
and
i
do
fearfully
believe
tis
done
what
we
so
fear
d
he
had
a
charge
to
do
salisbury
the
colour
of
the
king
doth
come
and
go
between
his
purpose
and
his
conscience
like
heralds
twixt
two
dreadful
battles
set
his
passion
is
so
ripe
it
needs
must
break
pembroke
and
when
it
breaks
i
fear
will
issue
thence
the
foul
corruption
of
a
sweet
child
s
death
king
john
we
cannot
hold
mortality
s
strong
hand
good
lords
although
my
will
to
give
is
living
the
suit
which
you
demand
is
gone
and
dead
he
tells
us
arthur
is
deceased
to
night
salisbury
indeed
we
fear
d
his
sickness
was
past
cure
pembroke
indeed
we
heard
how
near
his
death
he
was
before
the
child
himself
felt
he
was
sick
this
must
be
answer
d
either
here
or
hence
king
john
why
do
you
bend
such
solemn
brows
on
me
think
you
i
bear
the
shears
of
destiny
have
i
commandment
on
the
pulse
of
life
salisbury
it
is
apparent
foul
play
and
tis
shame
that
greatness
should
so
grossly
offer
it
so
thrive
it
in
your
game
and
so
farewell
pembroke
stay
yet
lord
salisbury
i
ll
go
with
thee
and
find
the
inheritance
of
this
poor
child
his
little
kingdom
of
a
forced
grave
that
blood
which
owed
the
breadth
of
all
this
isle
three
foot
of
it
doth
hold
bad
world
the
while
this
must
not
be
thus
borne
this
will
break
out
to
all
our
sorrows
and
ere
long
i
doubt
exeunt
lords
king
john
they
burn
in
indignation
i
repent
there

fearful
eye

where

motion
king

five
moons

old
men
and
beldams
in
the
streets
do
prophesy
upon
it
dangerously
young
arthur

death

common
in
their
mouths
and
when
they
talk
of
him
they
shake
their
heads
and
whisper
one
another
in
the
ear
and
he
that
speaks
doth
gripe
the
hearer

wrist
whilst
he
that
hears
makes
fearful
action

wrinkled
brows

nods

why
did
you
not
provoke
me

it
is
the
curse
of
kings
to
be
attended
by
slaves
that
take
their
humours
for

thou
fought
between
compulsion
and
a
brave
respect
let
me
wipe
off
this
honourable
dew
that
silverly
doth
progress
on
thy
cheeks
my
heart
hath
melted
at
a
lady
s
tears
being
an
ordinary
inundation
but
this
effusion
of
such
manly
drops
this
shower
blown
up
by
tempest
of
the
soul
startles
mine
eyes
and
makes
me
more
amazed
than
had
i
seen
the
vaulty
top
of

figured
quite
o
er
with
burning
meteors
lift
up
thy
brow
renowned
salisbury
and
with
a
great
heart
heave
away
the
storm
commend
these
waters
to
those
baby
eyes
that
never
saw
the
giant
world
enraged
nor
met
with
fortune
other
than
at
feasts
full
of
warm
blood
of
mirth
of
gossiping

shalt
thrust
thy

as
deep
into

and
unadvised
revel
this

d
sauciness

the

doth
smile
at

is
well
prepared
to
whip
this
dwarfish
war
these
pigmy
arms
from
out
the
circle
of
his
territories
that
hand
which
had
the
strength
even
at
your
door
to
cudgel
you
and
make
you
take
the
hatch
to
dive
like
buckets
in

of
your

planks
to
lie
like
pawns
lock
d
up
in
chests

to
hug
with
swine
to
seek
sweet
safety
out
in

henry
it

too
late
the

corruptibly

some
suppose

idle
comments
that
it
makes
foretell
the
ending
of
mortality
enter
pembroke
pembroke
his
highness
yet
doth
speak
and
holds
belief
that
being

it
would
allay
the
burning
quality
of
that
fell
poison

tis
strange
that

this
pale
faint
swan
who
chants
a

hymn
to
his

a
chair

now
my
soul
hath
elbow
room
it
would
not
out
at
windows
nor
at
doors
there
is
so
hot
a
summer
in
my
bosom
that
all
my
bowels
crumble
up
to
dust
i
am
a
scribbled
form
drawn
with
a
pen
upon
a
parchment
and
against
this
fire
do
i
shrink
up
prince
henry
how
fares
your
majesty
king
john
poison
d
ill
fare
dead
forsook
cast
off
and
none
of
you
will
bid
the
winter
come
to
thrust
his
icy
fingers
in
my
maw
nor
let
my
kingdom
s
rivers
take
their
course
through
my
burn
d
bosom
nor
entreat
the
north
to
make
his
bleak
winds
kiss
my
parched
lips
and
comfort
me
with
cold
i
do
not
ask
you
much
i
beg
cold
comfort
and
you
are
so
strait
and
so
ingrateful
you
deny
me
that
prince
henry
o
that
there
were
some
virtue
in
my
tears
that
might
relieve
you
king
john
the
salt
in
them
is
hot
within
me

a
hell
and
there

poison
is
as
a
fiend
confined
to
tyrannize
on
unreprievable
condemned
blood

bastard

o
i
am
scalded
with
my
violent
motion
and
spleen

art
come
to
set
mine
eye

my
heart
is
crack

and
all
the
shrouds
wherewith
my
life
should
sail
are
turned
to
one
thread
one
little
hair
my
heart
hath
one
poor
string
to
stay
it
by
which
holds
but
till
thy
news
be
uttered
and
then
all
this
thou
seest
is
but
a
clod
and
module
of
confounded
royalty
bastard
the
dauphin
is
preparing
hitherward
where
heaven
he
knows
how
we
shall
answer
him
for
in
a
night
the
best
part
of
my
power
as

upon
advantage
did
remove

in
the
washes
all
unwarily
devoured
by
the
unexpected
flood

these
dead
news
in
as
dead
an
ear
my
liege
my
lord
but
now
a
king

prince
henry
even
so
must
i
run
on
and
even
so

the
world

when
this
was
now
a
king
and
now
is
clay
bastard

thou
gone
so
i
do
but
stay
behind
to
do
the
office
for
thee
of
revenge
and
then
my
soul
shall
wait
on
thee
to
heaven
as
it
on
earth
hath
been
thy
servant
still
now
now
you
stars
that
move
in
your
right
spheres
where
be
your
powers

now
your
mended
faiths
and
instantly
return
with
me
again
to
push
destruction
and
perpetual
shame
out
of
the
weak
door
of
our
fainting
land
straight
let
us
seek
or
straight
we
shall
be
sought

at
our
very
heels

so
much
as

cardinal
pandulph
is
within
at
rest
who
half
an
hour
since
came
from
the
dauphin
and
brings
from
him
such
offers
of
our
peace
as
we
with
honour
and
respect
may
take
with
purpose
presently
to
leave
this
war
bastard

will
the
rather
do
it
when
he
sees
ourselves
well
sinewed
to
our
defence
salisbury

it
is
in
a
manner
done
already
for
many
carriages

hath
dispatch

the
sea
side
and
put
his
cause
and
quarrel
to
the
disposing
of
the
cardinal
with
whom
yourself
myself
and
other
lords
if
you
think
meet
this
afternoon

post
to
consummate
this
business

hath
been
beforehand
with
our
griefs

england

did
nor
never
shall
lie
at
the
proud
foot
of
a
conqueror
but
when

wound
itself

come
home
again

three
corners
of
