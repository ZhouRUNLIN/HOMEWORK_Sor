i
thought
the

had
more
affected
the

than
cornwall
gloucester
it
did
always
seem
so
to
us
but
now
in
the
division
of

it
appears
not
which
of
the

he
values
most
for

are
so
weighed
that

some
year
elder

yet
is
no
dearer
in

though
this

came
something
saucily
into

nor
will
you
tender

king

noble
burgundy
when
she
was

we
did
hold
her

but
now
her

nothing

there
and
she
is
yours

i
know
no

king

will
you
with
those
infirmities
she
owes
unfriended

adopted
to
our

with
our

take
her

pardon
me
royal
sir

up
on
such
conditions
king

then
leave
her

for
by
the
power
that
made
me
i
tell
you
all
her
wealth
to

for
you
great
king
i
would
not
from
your

make
such
a
stray
to
match
you

i
hate
therefore
beseech
you
to
avert
your
liking
a
more
worthier
way
than
on
a
wretch
whom
nature
is
ashamed
almost
to
acknowledge
hers
king
of
france
this
is
most
strange
that
she
that
even
but
now
was
your
best
object
the
argument
of
your
praise
balm
of
your
age
most
best
most
dearest

in
this
trice
of

commit
a
thing
so
monstrous
to
dismantle
so
many
folds
of

sure
her
offence
must
be
of
such
unnatural
degree
that
monsters
it
or
your
fore
vouch
d
affection
fall
n
into
taint
which
to
believe
of
her
must
be
a
faith
that
reason
without
miracle
could
never
plant
in
me
cordelia
i
yet
beseech
your
majesty
if
for
i
want
that
glib
and
oily
art
to
speak
and
purpose
not
since
what
i
well
intend
i
ll
do
t
before
i
speak
that
you
make
known
it
is
no
vicious
blot
murder
or
foulness
no
unchaste
action
or
dishonour
d
step
that
hath
deprived
me
of
your
grace
and
favour
but
even
for
want
of
that
for
which
i
am
richer
a
still
soliciting
eye
and
such
a
tongue
as
i
am
glad
i
have
not
though
not
to
have
it
hath
lost
me
in
your
liking
king
lear
better
thou
hadst
not
been
born
than
not
to
have
pleased
me
better
king
of

is
it
but
this
a
tardiness
in
nature
which
often
leaves
the
history
unspoke
that
it
intends
to
do
my
lord

burgundy
what
say
you
to
the

i
have
to

regan
that
s
most
certain
and
with
you
next

with

goneril
you
see
how
full
of
changes
his
age
is
the
observation
we
have
made
of
it
hath
not
been
little
he
always
loved
our
sister
most
and
with
what
poor
judgment
he
hath
now
cast
her
off
appears
too
grossly
regan
tis
the
infirmity
of
his
age
yet
he
hath
ever
but
slenderly
known
himself
goneril
the
best
and
soundest
of
his
time
hath
been
but
rash
then
must
we
look
to
receive
from
his
age
not
alone
the
imperfections
of
long
engraffed
condition
but
therewithal
the
unruly
waywardness
that
infirm
and
choleric
years
bring
with
them
regan
such
unconstant
starts
are
we
like
to
have
from
him
as
this
of
kent
s
banishment
goneril
there
is
further
compliment
of
leavetaking
between
france
and
him
pray
you
let
s
hit
together
if
our
father
carry
authority
with
such
dispositions
as
he
bears
this
last
surrender
of
his
will
but
offend
us
regan
we
shall
further

till
our
oldness

begin
to
find
an
idle
and
fond
bondage
in
the
oppression
of
aged
tyranny
who
sways
not
as
it
hath
power
but
as
it
is
suffered
come
to

that
of

i
may
speak

i
have
heard

till
you
can
derive
from
him
better
testimony
of
his
intent
you
shall
run
a
certain
course
where
if
you
violently
proceed
against

mistaking
his
purpose
it
would
make
a
great
gap
in
your
own
honour
and
shake
in
pieces
the
heart
of
his
obedience
i
dare
pawn
down
my
life
for

not
sure
though
hoping
of

good
success
i
ask
d
his
blessing

from
first
to

told
him
my
pilgrimage

his
flaw

twixt
two
extremes
of

joy

grief
burst
smilingly

this
speech
of
yours
