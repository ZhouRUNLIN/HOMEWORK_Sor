lies
the
scene
from
isles
of
greece
the
princes
orgulous
their
high
blood
chafed
have
to
the
port
of
athens
sent
their
ships
fraught
with
the
ministers
and
instruments
of
cruel
war
sixty
and
nine
that
wore
their
crownets
regal
from
the
athenian
bay
put
forth
toward
phrygia
and
their
vow
is
made
to
ransack
troy
within
whose
strong
immures
the
ravish
d
helen
menelaus
queen
with
wanton
paris
sleeps
and
that
s
the
quarrel
to
tenedos
they
come
and
the
deep
drawing
barks
do
there
disgorge
their
warlike
fraughtage
now
on
dardan
plains
the
fresh
and
yet
unbruised
greeks
do
pitch
their
brave
pavilions
priam
s
six
gated
city
dardan
and
tymbria
helias
chetas
troien
and
antenorides
with
massy
staples
and
corresponsive
and
fulfilling

up
the
sons
of
troy
now
expectation
tickling
skittish
spirits
on
one
and
other
side
trojan
and
greek
sets
all
on
hazard
and
hither
am
i
come
a
prologue
arm
d
but
not
in
confidence
of
author
s
pen
or
actor
s
voice
but
suited
in
like
conditions
as
our
argument
to
tell
you
fair
beholders
that
our
play
leaps
o
er
the
vaunt
and
firstlings
of
those
broils
beginning
in
the
middle
starting
thence
away
to
what
may
be
digested
in
a
play
like
or
find
fault
do
as
your
pleasures
are
now
good
or
bad
tis
but
the
chance
of
war
scene
i
troy
before
priam
s
palace
enter
troilus
armed
and
pandarus
troilus
call
here
my
varlet
i
ll
unarm
again
why
should
i
war
without
the
walls
of
troy
that
find
such
cruel
battle
here
within
each
trojan
that
is
master
of
his
heart
let
him
to
field
troilus
alas
hath
none
pandarus
will
this
gear
ne
er
be
mended
troilus
the
greeks
are
strong
and
skilful
to
their
strength
fierce
to
their
skill
and
to
their
fierceness
valiant
but
i
am
weaker
than
a
woman
s
tear
tamer
than
sleep
fonder
than
ignorance
less
valiant
than
the
virgin
in
the
night
and
skilless
as
unpractised
infancy
pandarus
well
i
have
told
you
enough
of
this
for
my
part
i
ll
not
meddle
nor
make
no
further
he
that
will
have
a
cake
out
of
the
wheat
must
needs
tarry
the
grinding
troilus
have
i
not
tarried
pandarus
ay
the
grinding
but
you
must
tarry
the
bolting
troilus
have
i
not
tarried
pandarus
ay
the
bolting
but
you
must
tarry
the
leavening
troilus
still
have
i
tarried
pandarus
ay
to
the
leavening
but
here
s
yet
in
the
word
hereafter
the
kneading
the
making
of
the
cake
the
heating
of
the
oven
and
the
baking
nay
you
must
stay
the
cooling
too
or
you
may
chance
to
burn
your
lips
troilus
patience
herself
what
goddess
e
er
she
be
doth
lesser
blench
at
sufferance
than
i
do
at
priam
s
royal
table
do
i
sit
and
when
fair
cressid
comes
into
my
thoughts
so
traitor
when
she
comes
when
is
she
thence
pandarus
well
she
looked
yesternight
fairer
than
ever
i
saw
her
look
or
any
woman
else
troilus
i
was
about
to
tell
thee
when
my
heart
as
wedged
with
a
sigh
would
rive
in
twain
lest
hector
or
my
father
should
perceive
me
i
have
as
when
the
sun
doth
light
a
storm
buried
this
sigh
in
wrinkle
of
a
smile
but
sorrow
that
is
couch
d
in
seeming
gladness
is
like
that
mirth
fate
turns
to
sudden
sadness
pandarus
an
her
hair
were
not
somewhat
darker
than
helen
s
well
go
to
there
were
no
more
comparison
between
the
women
but
for
my
part
she
is
my
kinswoman
i
would
not
as
they
term
it
praise
her
but
i
would
somebody
had
heard
her
talk
yesterday
as
i
did
i
will
not
dispraise
your
sister
cassandra
s
wit
but
troilus
o
pandarus
i
tell
thee
pandarus
when
i
do
tell
thee
there
my
hopes
lie
drown
d
reply
not
in
how
many
fathoms
deep
they
lie
indrench
d
i
tell
thee
i
am
mad
in
cressid

in
the
open
ulcer
of
my
heart
her
eyes
her
hair

cheek

gait
her
voice
handlest
in
thy
discourse
o
that
her
hand
in
whose
comparison
all
whites
are
ink
writing
their
own
reproach
to
whose
soft
seizure
the
cygnet
s
down
is
harsh
and
spirit
of
sense
hard
as
the
palm
of
ploughman
this
thou
tell
st
me
as
true
thou
tell
st
me
when
i
say
i
love
her
but
saying
thus
instead
of
oil
and
balm
thou
lay
st
in
every
gash
that
love
hath
given
me
the
knife
that
made
it
pandarus
i
speak
no
more
than
truth
troilus
thou
dost
not
speak
so
much
pandarus

had
my
labour
for
my
travail

thought
on
of

between
and
between
but
small
thanks
for
my
labour
troilus
what
art
thou
angry
pandarus

as
helen
an
she
were
not
kin
to
me
she
would
be
as
fair
on
friday

i
cannot
fight
upon
this
argument
it

subject
for
my
sword

ii

same
a
street

cressida
and
alexander
cressida
who
were
those
went
by
alexander
queen
hecuba
and
helen
cressida
and
whither
go
they
alexander
up
to
the
eastern
tower
whose
height
commands
as
subject
all
the
vale
to
see
the
battle
hector
whose
patience
is
as
a
virtue
fix
d
to
day
was
moved
he
chid
andromache
and
struck
his
armourer
and
like
as
there
were
husbandry
in
war
before
the
sun
rose
he
was
harness
d
light
and
to
the
field
goes
he
where
every
flower
did
as
a
prophet
weep
what
it
foresaw
in
hector
s
wrath
cressida
what
was
his
cause
of
anger
alexander
the
noise
goes
this
there
is
among
the
greeks
a
lord
of
trojan
blood
nephew
to
hector
they
call
him
ajax
cressida
good
and
what
of
him
alexander
they
say
he
is
a
very
man
per
se
and
stands
alone
cressida
so
do
all
men
unless
they
are
drunk
sick
or
have
no
legs
alexander
this
man
lady
hath
robbed
many
beasts
of
their
particular
additions
he
is
as
valiant
as
the
lion
churlish
as
the
bear
slow
as
the
elephant
a
man
into
whom
nature
hath
so
crowded
humours
that
his
valour
is
crushed
into
folly
his
folly
sauced
with
discretion
there
is
no
man
hath
a
virtue
that
he
hath
not
a
glimpse
of
nor
any
man
an
attaint
but
he
carries
some
stain
of
it
he
is
melancholy
without
cause
and
merry
against
the
hair
he
hath
the
joints
of
every
thing
but
everything
so
out
of
joint
that
he
is
a
gouty
briareus
many
hands
and
no
use
or
purblind
argus
all
eyes
and
no
sight
cressida
but
how
should
this
man
that
makes
me
smile
make
hector
angry
alexander
they
say
he
yesterday
coped
hector
in
the
battle
and
struck
him
down
the
disdain
and
shame
whereof
hath
ever
since
kept
hector
fasting
and
waking
cressida

say
for
i

sure

nor
hector
is
not
troilus
in
some
degrees
cressida
tis
just
to
each
of
them
he
is
himself
pandarus
himself
alas
poor
troilus
i
would
he
were
cressida
so
he
is
pandarus
condition
i
had
gone
barefoot
to
india
cressida
he
is
not
hector
pandarus

no
he
s
not
himself
would
a
were

the
gods
are
above
time
must
friend
or
end
well
troilus
well
i
would
my
heart
were
in
her
body
no
hector
is
not
a
better
man
than
troilus
cressida
excuse
me
pandarus
he
is
elder
cressida
pardon
me
pardon
me
pandarus
th
other
s
not
come
to
t
you
shall
tell
me
another
tale
when
th
other
s
come
to
t
hector
shall
not
have
his
wit
this
year
cressida
he
shall
not
need
it
if
he
have
his
own
pandarus
nor
his
qualities
cressida
no
matter
pandarus
nor
his
beauty
cressida
twould
not
become
him
his
own
s
better
pandarus
you
have
no
judgment
niece
helen
herself
swore
th
other
day
that
troilus
for
a
brown
favour
for
so
tis
i
must
confess
not
brown
neither
cressida
no
but
brown
pandarus
faith
to
say
truth
brown
and
not
brown
cressida
to
say
the
truth
true
and
not
true
pandarus
she
praised
his
complexion
above
paris
cressida
why
paris
hath
colour
enough
pandarus
so
he
has
cressida
then
troilus
should
have
too
much
if
she
praised
him
above
his
complexion
is
higher
than
his
he
having
colour
enough
and
the
other
higher
is
too
flaming
a
praise
for
a
good
complexion
i
had
as
lief
helen
s
golden
tongue
had
commended
troilus
for
a
copper
nose
pandarus
i
swear
to
you
i
think
helen
loves
him
better
than
paris
cressida
then
she
s
a
merry
greek
indeed
pandarus
nay
i
am
sure
she
does
she
came
to
him
th
other
day
into
the
compassed
window
and
you
know
he
has
not
past
three
or
four
hairs
on
his
chin
cressida
indeed
a
tapster
s
arithmetic
may
soon
bring
his
particulars
therein
to
a
total
pandarus
why
he
is
very
young
and
yet
will
he
within
three
pound
lift
as
much
as
his
brother
hector
cressida
is
he
so
young
a
man
and
so
old
a
lifter
pandarus
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
him
she
came
and
puts
me
her
white
hand
to
his
cloven
chin
cressida
juno
have
mercy
how
came
it
cloven
pandarus
why
you
know
tis
dimpled
i
think
his
smiling
becomes
him
better
than
any
man
in
all
phrygia
cressida
o
he
smiles
valiantly
pandarus
does
he
not
cressida
o
yes
an
twere
a
cloud
in
autumn
pandarus
why
go
to
then
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
troilus
cressida
troilus
will
stand
to
the
proof
if
you
ll
prove
it
so
pandarus
troilus
why
he
esteems
her
no
more
than
i
esteem
an
addle
egg
cressida
if
you
love
an
addle
egg
as
well
as
you
love
an
idle
head
you
would
eat
chickens
i
the
shell
pandarus
i
cannot
choose
but
laugh
to
think
how
she
tickled
his
chin
indeed
she
has
a
marvellous
white
hand
i
must
needs
confess
cressida
without
the
rack
pandarus
and
she
takes
upon
her
to
spy
a
white
hair
on
his
chin
cressida
alas
poor
chin
many
a
wart
is
richer
pandarus
but
there
was
such
laughing
queen
hecuba
laughed
that
her
eyes
ran
o
er
cressida
with
mill
stones
pandarus
and
cassandra
laughed
cressida
but
there
was
more
temperate
fire
under
the
pot
of
her
eyes
did
her
eyes
run
o
er
too
pandarus
and
hector
laughed
cressida
at
what
was
all
this
laughing
pandarus
marry
at
the
white
hair
that
helen
spied
on
troilus
chin
cressida
an
t
had
been
a
green
hair
i
should
have
laughed
too
pandarus
they
laughed
not
so
much
at
the
hair
as
at
his
pretty
answer
cressida
what
was
his
answer
pandarus
quoth
she
here
s
but
two
and
fifty
hairs
on
your
chin
and
one
of
them
is
white
cressida
this
is
her
question
pandarus
that
s
true
make
no
question
of
that
two
and
fifty
hairs
quoth
he
and
one
white
that
white
hair
is
my
father
and
all
the
rest
are
his
sons
jupiter
quoth
she
which
of
these
hairs
is
paris
my
husband
the
forked
one
quoth
he
pluck
t
out
and
give
it
him
but
there
was
such
laughing
and
helen
so
blushed
an
paris
so
chafed
and
all
the
rest
so
laughed
that
it
passed
cressida
so
let
it
now
for
it
has
been
while

in

i
ll
prove
this
truth
with

three
drops

ulysses
amen
agamemnon
fair
lord

to
our

of

nestor
ulysses
nestor
nestor
what
says
ulysses
ulysses
i
have
a
young
conception
in
my
brain
be
you
my
time
to
bring
it
to
some
shape
nestor
what
is
t
ulysses
this
tis
blunt
wedges
rive
hard
knots
the
seeded
pride
that
hath
to
this
maturity
blown
up
in
rank
achilles
must
or
now
be
cropp
d
or
shedding
breed
a
nursery
of
like
evil
to
overbulk
us
all
nestor
well
and
how
ulysses
this
challenge
that
the
gallant
hector
sends
however
it
is
spread
in
general
name
relates
in
purpose
only
to
achilles
nestor
the
purpose
is
perspicuous
even
as
substance
whose
grossness
little
characters
sum
up
and
in
the
publication
make
no
strain
but
that
achilles
were
his
brain
as
barren
as
banks
of
libya
though
apollo
knows
tis
dry
enough
will
with
great
speed
of
judgment
ay
with
celerity
find
hector
s
purpose
pointing
on
him
ulysses
and
wake
him
to
the
answer
think
you
nestor
yes
tis
most
meet
whom
may
you
else
oppose
that
can
from
hector
bring
his
honour
off
if
not
achilles
though
t
be
a
sportful
combat
yet
in
the
trial
much
opinion
dwells
for
here
the
trojans
taste
our
dear
st
repute
with
their
finest
palate
and
trust
to
me
ulysses
our
imputation
shall
be
oddly
poised
in
this
wild
action
for
the
success
although
particular
shall
give
a
scantling
of
good
or
bad
unto
the
general
and
in
such
indexes
although
small
pricks
to
their
subsequent
volumes
there
is
seen
the
baby
figure
of
the
giant
mass
of
things
to
come
at
large
it
is
supposed
he
that
meets
hector
issues
from
our
choice
and
choice
being
mutual
act
of
all
our
souls
makes
merit
her
election
and
doth
boil
as
twere
from
us
all
a
man
distill
d
out
of
our
virtues
who
miscarrying
what
heart
receives
from
hence
the
conquering
part
to
steel
a
strong
opinion
to
themselves
which
entertain
d
limbs
are
his
instruments
in
no
less
working
than
are
swords
and
bows
directive
by
the
limbs
ulysses
give
pardon
to
my
speech
therefore
tis
meet
achilles
meet
not
hector
let
us
like
merchants
show
our
foulest
wares
and
think
perchance
they
ll
sell
if
not
the
lustre
of
the
better
yet
to
show
shall
show
the
better
do
not
consent
that
ever
hector
and
achilles
meet
for
both
our
honour
and
our
shame
in
this
are
dogg

with
two
strange
followers
nestor
i
see
them
not
with
my
old

what
are
they
ulysses
what
glory
our
achilles
shares
from
hector
were
he
not
proud
we
all
should
share
with
him
but
he
already
is
too
insolent
a
nd
we
were
better
parch
in
afric
sun
than
in
the
pride
and
salt
scorn
of
his
eyes
should
he
scape
hector
fair
if
he
were

d
why
then
we
did
our
main

crush

of
our

and
by
device
let
blockish

draw

to

give
him

for
the

the
great

broils
in
loud
applause
and
make
him
fall
his

that
prouder
than

if
the
dull
brainless
ajax
come
safe
off
we
ll
dress
him
up
in

if

under
our

that

nor
none
so
noble
whose

were
ill

unfamed
where

i

you

have
glozed

superficially
not
much
unlike
young

whom

thought
unfit
to
hear

the
reasons
you
allege
do
more
conduce
to
the

to
make
up

ne

my
spritely
brethren
i
propend
to
you

i
would
not
wish

of

spent
more
in
her
defence

worthy

she
is
a
theme
of
honour

renown
a
spur
to
valiant
and
magnanimous
deeds
whose
present
courage
may
beat
down

foes

in

not
lose

no

for
your
health

sake

the

yet
all
his
virtues
not
virtuously
on
his
own
part
beheld
do
in
our
eyes
begin
to
lose
their
gloss
yea
like
fair

like
to

untasted
go
and
tell
him
we
come
to
speak
with

and
you
shall
not
sin
if
you
do
say
we
think
him
over
proud
and
under
honest
in
self
assumption
greater
than
in
the
note
of

and
worthier
than
himself

no

ajax
will
you
subscribe
his

ajax
you
are
as
strong
as
valiant
as

no

noble
much
more

ajax
why
should
a

be
proud
how
doth

grow
i

not
what
pride
is
agamemnon
your
mind
is
the
clearer
ajax

your

the
fairer
he
that
is
proud
eats
up
himself
pride
is
his

glass
his

his

chronicle
and
whatever
praises
itself
but
in
the
deed
devours
the
deed
in
the
praise
ajax
i
do
hate
a

by
my
will
assubjugate
his

how

have
i

thus
cressida
wished
my

the

grant
o
my

troilus
what
should
they
grant
what
makes
this
pretty
abruption
what
too
curious
dreg
espies
my
sweet

in
the

of
our

cressida
more

if
my

they
never

no

in

cupid
s
pageant
there
is
presented
no
monster
cressida
nor
nothing
monstrous
neither
troilus
nothing
but
our
undertakings
when
we
vow
to
weep
seas
live
in
fire
eat
rocks
tame
tigers
thinking
it
harder
for
our
mistress
to
devise
imposition
enough
than
for
us
to
undergo
any
difficulty
imposed
this
is
the
monstruosity
in
love
lady
that
the
will
is
infinite
and
the
execution
confined
that
the
desire
is
boundless
and
the
act
a
slave
to
limit
cressida
they
say
all
lovers
swear
more
performance
than
they
are
able
and
yet
reserve
an
ability
that
they
never
perform
vowing
more
than
the
perfection
of
ten
and
discharging
less
than
the
tenth
part
of
one
they
that
have
the
voice
of
lions
and
the
act
of
hares
are
they
not

for

me
now
and
brings
me
heart
prince
troilus
i
have
loved
you
night
and

for
many
weary
months
troilus
why
was
my
cressid
then
so
hard
to
win
cressida
hard
to
seem
won
but
i
was
won
my
lord
with
the
first
glance
that
ever
pardon
me
if
i
confess
much
you
will
play
the
tyrant
i
love
you
now
but
not
till
now
so
much
but
i
might
master
it
in
faith
i
lie
my
thoughts
were
like
unbridled
children
grown
too
headstrong
for
their
mother
see
we
fools
why
have
i
blabb
d
who
shall
be
true
to
us
when
we
are
so
unsecret
to
ourselves
but
though
i
loved
you
well
i
woo
d
you
not
and
yet
good
faith
i
wish
d
myself
a
man
or
that
we
women
had
men
s
privilege
of
speaking
first
sweet
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
for
in
this
rapture
i
shall
surely
speak
the
thing
i
shall
repent
see
see
your
silence
cunning
in
dumbness
from
my
weakness
draws
my
very
soul
of
counsel
stop
my
mouth
troilus
and
shall
albeit
sweet
music
issues
thence
pandarus
pretty
i
faith
cressida
my
lord
i
do
beseech
you
pardon
me
twas
not
my
purpose
thus
to
beg
a
kiss
i
am
ashamed
o
heavens
what
have
i
done
for
this
time
will
i
take
my
leave
my
lord
troilus
your
leave
sweet
cressid
pandarus
leave
an
you
take
leave
till
to
morrow
morning

pray
you
content
you
troilus
what
offends
you
lady
cressida
sir
mine
own
company
troilus
you
cannot
shun
yourself
cressida
let
me
go
and
try
i
have
a
kind
of
self
resides
with
you
but
an
unkind
self
that
itself
will
leave
to
be
another
s
fool
i
would
be
gone
where
is
my
wit
i
know
not
what
i
speak
troilus
well
know
they
what
they
speak
that
speak
so
wisely
cressida
perchance
my
lord
i
show
more
craft
than
love
and
fell
so
roundly
to
a
large
confession
to
angle
for
your
thoughts
but
you
are
wise
or
else
you
love
not
for
to
be
wise
and
love
exceeds
man
s
might
that
dwells
with
gods
above
troilus
o
that
i
thought
it
could
be
in
a
woman
as
if
it
can
i
will
presume
in
you
to
feed
for
aye
her
ramp
and
flames
of
love
to
keep
her
constancy
in
plight
and
youth
outliving
beauty
s
outward
with
a
mind
that
doth
renew
swifter
than
blood
decays
or
that
persuasion
could
but
thus
convince
me
that
my
integrity
and
truth
to
you
might
be
affronted
with
the
match
and
weight
of
such
a
winnow
d
purity
in
love
how
were
i
then
uplifted
but
alas
i
am
as
true
as

simplicity
and
simpler
than
the
infancy
of

cressida
in
that

what
the
declined
is

shall
as
soon
read
in
the
eyes
of

as
feel
in
his
own
fall
for
men
like
butterflies
show
not
their
mealy
wings
but
to
the
summer
and
not
a
man
for
being
simply
man

any

but
honour
for
those
honours
that
are
without
him
as
place

prizes
of

as
oft
as

when
they
fall
as
being
slippery

that
lean

on

as
slippery
too
do
one
pluck
down
another
and
together
die
in
the
fall
but
tis
not
so
with
me
fortune
and
i
are
friends
i
do
enjoy
at
ample
point
all
that
i
did
possess
save
these
men
s
looks
who
do
methinks
find
out
something
not
worth
in
me
such
rich
beholding
as
they
have
often
given
here

ulysses
i
ll
interrupt
his
reading
how
now
ulysses
ulysses
now
great
thetis
son
achilles
what
are
you
reading
ulysses
a
strange
fellow
here
writes
me
that
man
how
dearly
ever
parted
how
much
in
having
or
without
or
in
cannot
make
boast
to
have
that
which
he
hath
nor
feels
not
what
he
owes
but
by
reflection
as
when
his
virtues
shining
upon
others
heat
them
and
they
retort
that
heat
again
to
the
first
giver
achilles
this
is
not
strange
ulysses
the
beauty
that
is
borne
here
in
the
face
the
bearer
knows
not
but
commends
itself
to
others
eyes
nor
doth
the
eye
itself
that
most
pure
spirit
of
sense
behold
itself
not
going
from
itself
but
eye
to
eye
opposed
salutes

other

speculation
turns
not
to
itself
till
it
hath
travell
d
and
is
mirror
d
there
where
it
may
see
itself
this
is
not
strange
at
all
ulysses
i
do
not
strain
at
the
position
it
is
familiar
but
at
the
author
s
drift
who
in
his
circumstance
expressly
proves
that
no
man
is
the
lord
of
any
thing
though
in
and
of
him
there
be
much
consisting
till
he
communicate
his
parts
to
others
nor
doth
he
of
himself
know
them
for
aught
till
he
behold
them
form
d
in
the
applause
where
they
re
extended
who
like
an
arch
reverberates
the
voice
again
or
like
a
gate
of
steel
fronting
the
sun
receives
and
renders
back
his
figure
and
his
heat
i
was
much
wrapt
in
this
and
apprehended
here
immediately
the
unknown
ajax
heavens
what
a
man
is
there
a
very
horse
that
has
he
knows
not
what
nature
what
things
there
are
most
abject
in
regard
and
dear
in
use
what
things
again
most
dear
in
the
esteem
and
poor
in
worth
now
shall
we
see
to

an
act
that
very
chance
doth
throw
upon
him
ajax
renown
d
o

what
some
men
do
while
some

leave
to
do
how
some

creep
in

whiles
others
play
the
idiots
in

eyes
how
one
man
eats
into
another
s
pride
while
pride
is
fasting
in
his
wantonness
to
see
these
grecian
lords
why
even
already
they
clap
the
lubber
ajax
on
the
shoulder
as
if
his
foot
were
on
brave
hector
s
breast
and
great
troy
shrieking
achilles
i
do
believe
it
for
they
pass
d
by
me
as
misers
do
by
beggars
neither
gave
to
me
good
word
nor
look
what
are
my

hath
my

a

at
his

wherein
he
puts

for

of
ingratitudes
those
scraps
are

is
to

mongst
the

achilles
of

i
have
strong
reasons
ulysses
but
gainst
your

the
reasons
are
more
potent
and
heroical
tis
known
achilles
that
you
are
in
love
with
one
of
priam

daughters
achilles
ha
known

is
that
a
wonder
the

that

in
a
watchful
state
knows
almost
every
grain
of
plutus
gold
finds
bottom
in
the
uncomprehensive
deeps
keeps
place
with

and
almost
like
the

does

unveil
in
their
dumb
cradles
there
is
a
mystery
with
whom
relation
durst
never
meddle
in
the

of

which
hath
an
operation
more
divine
than

to
all
the
commerce
that
you
have
had
with
troy
as
perfectly
is
ours
as
yours
my
lord
and
better
would
it
fit
achilles
much
to
throw
down
hector
than
polyxena

it
must
grieve
young
pyrrhus
now
at
home
when
fame
shall
in
our
islands
sound
her
trump
and
all
the
greekish
girls
shall
tripping
sing
great
hector

did
achilles
win

our
great
ajax
bravely
beat
down
him
farewell
my

i
as
your

that
you
should
break

achilles
have
i
moved
you
a
woman
impudent
and
mannish
grown
is
not
more
loathed
than
an
effeminate
man
in
time
of
action
i
stand
condemn
d
for
this
they
think
my
little
stomach
to
the
war
and
your
great
love
to
me
restrains
you
thus
sweet
rouse
yourself
and
the
weak
wanton
cupid
shall
from
your
neck
unloose
his
amorous
fold
and
like
a
dew
drop
from
the
lion
s
mane
be
shook
to
air
achilles
shall
ajax
fight
with
hector
patroclus
ay
and
perhaps
receive
much
honour
by
him
achilles
i
see
my
reputation
is
at
stake
my
fame
is
shrewdly
gored
patroclus
o
then
beware
those
wounds
heal
ill
that
men
do
give
themselves
omission
to
do
what
is
necessary
seals
a
commission
to
a
blank
of
danger
and
danger
like
an
ague
subtly
taints
even
then
when
we
sit
idly
in
the
sun
achilles
go
call
thersites
hither
sweet
patroclus
i
ll
send
the
fool
to
ajax
and
desire
him
to
invite
the
trojan
lords
after
the
combat
to
see
us
here
unarm
d
i
have
a
woman
s
longing
an
appetite
that
i
am
sick
withal
to
see
great
hector
in
his
weeds
of
peace
to
talk
with
him
and
to
behold
his
visage
even
to
my
full
of
view
enter
thersites
a
labour
saved
thersites
a
wonder
achilles
what
thersites
ajax
goes
up
and
down
the
field
asking
for
himself
achilles
how
so
thersites
he
must
fight
singly
to
morrow
with
hector
and
is
so
prophetically
proud
of
an
heroical
cudgelling
that
he
raves
in
saying
nothing
achilles
how
can
that
be
thersites
why
he
stalks
up
and
down
like
a
peacock
a
stride
and
a
stand
ruminates
like
an
hostess
that
hath
no
arithmetic
but
her
brain
to
set
down
her
reckoning
bites
his
lip
with
a
politic
regard
as
who
should
say
there
were
wit
in
this
head
an
twould
out
and
so
there
is
but
it
lies
as
coldly
in
him
as
fire
in
a
flint
which
will
not
show
without
knocking
the
man
s
undone
forever
for
if
hector
break
not
his
neck
i
the
combat
he
ll
break
t
himself
in
vain
glory
he
knows
not
me
i
said
good
morrow
ajax
and
he
replies
thanks
agamemnon
what
think
you
of
this
man
that
takes
me
for
the
general
he
s
grown
a
very
land

a
plague
of

now
by

life
welcome
indeed

worse
paris
this
is
the
most
despiteful
gentle
greeting
the
noblest
hateful
love
that
e
er
i
heard
of
what
business

so
early
aeneas
i
was
sent
for
to
the
king
but
why
i
know
not
paris
his
purpose
meets
you
twas
to

there
to
render

fair
cressid
let

have
your
company
or
if
you
please
haste
there
before

i
constantly
do
think
or
rather
call

thought
a
certain
knowledge
my
brother
troilus
lodges
there
to
night
rouse
him
and
give
him
note
of
our
approach
with
the
whole
quality
wherefore
i
fear
we
shall
be
much
unwelcome
aeneas
that
i
assure
you
troilus
had
rather
troy
were
borne
to
greece
than
cressid
borne
from
troy
paris
there
is
no
help
the
bitter
disposition
of
the
time

have
it
so
on
lord

tell
me
noble
diomed

a
hell
of
pain

you
as
well
to
keep
her

her
not
palating
the
taste
of
her
dishonour
with
such
a
costly
loss
of
wealth
and
friends
he

that
there

no

in

the
grecian
youths

full
of

they
re
loving
well
composed
with
gifts
of
nature
flowing
and
swelling
o
er
with
arts
and
exercise
how
novelty
may
move
and
parts
with

alas
a
kind
of
godly
jealousy
which
i
beseech
you
call
a
virtuous
sin
makes
me
afeard
cressida
o
heavens
you
love
me
not
troilus
die
i
a
villain
then
in
this
i
do
not
call
your

i
cannot
sing

heel

nor
sweeten
talk
nor
play
at
subtle
games
fair
virtues
all
to
which
the
grecians
are
most
prompt
and
pregnant
but
i
can
tell
that
in
each
grace
of
these
there
lurks
a
still
and
dumb
discoursive
devil
that
tempts
most
cunningly
but
be
not
tempted
cressida
do
you
think
i
will
troilus
no
but
something
may
be
done
that
we
will
not

sometimes
we
are
devils
to
ourselves
when

tempt
the
frailty
of

his

both
free

he
gives

gives
he
not

his
bounty
nor
dignifies
an
impure
thought
with

manly
as
hector
but
more
dangerous
for
hector

his
blaze
of
wrath
subscribes
to
tender
objects
but
he
in
heat
of
action
is
more
vindicative
than
jealous
love
they
call
him
troilus
and
on
him
erect
a
second
hope
as
fairly
built
as
hector
thus
says
aeneas
one
that
knows
the
youth
even
to
his
inches
and
with
private
soul
did
in
great
ilion
thus
translate
him
to
me
alarum

that
thou
couldst
say
this

this
sinister
bounds
in

thou
shouldst
not
bear
from
me
a
greekish
member
wherein
my

the
just
gods
gainsay

is

could
promise
to

a

of

the
sides

and
portly
size
agamemnon

as
welcome
as

deadly
theme
hector
o
pardon

offend
nestor
i
have
thou
gallant
trojan
seen
thee
oft
labouring
for
destiny
make
cruel
way
through
ranks
of
greekish
youth
and
i
have
seen
thee
as
hot
as
perseus
spur
thy
phrygian
steed
despising
many
forfeits
and
subduements
when
thou
hast
hung
thy
advanced
sword
i
the
air
not
letting
it
decline
on
the
declined
that
i
have
said
to
some
my
standers
by
lo
jupiter
is
yonder
dealing
life
and
i
have
seen
thee
pause
and
take
thy
breath
when
that
a
ring
of
greeks
have
hemm
d
thee
in
like
an
olympian
wrestling
this
have
i
seen
but
this
thy
countenance
still
lock
d
in
steel
i
never
saw
till
now
i
knew
thy
grandsire
and
once
fought
with
him
he
was
a
soldier
good
but
by
great
mars
the
captain
of
us
all
never
saw
like
thee
let
an
old
man
embrace
thee
and
worthy
warrior
welcome
to
our
tents
aeneas
tis
the
old
nestor
hector
let
me
embrace
thee
good
old
chronicle
that
hast
so
long
walk
d
hand
in
hand
with
time
most
reverend
nestor
i
am
glad
to
clasp
thee
nestor
i
would
my
arms
could
match
thee
in
contention
as
they
contend
with
thee
in
courtesy
hector
i
would
they
could
nestor
ha
by
this
white
beard
i
ld
fight
with
thee
to

well
welcome
welcome
i
have
seen

time
ulysses

here
her
base
and
pillar
by
us
hector
i
know
your
favour
lord
ulysses
well
ah
sir
there
s
many
a
greek
and
trojan
dead
since
first
i
saw
yourself
and
diomed
in
ilion
on
your
greekish
embassy
ulysses
sir
i
foretold
you
then
what
would
ensue
my
prophecy
is
but
half
his
journey
yet
for
yonder
walls
that
pertly
front
your
town
yond
towers
whose
wanton
tops
do
buss
the
clouds
must
kiss
their
own
feet
hector
i
must
not
believe
you
there
they
stand
yet
and
modestly
i
think
the
fall
of
every
phrygian
stone
will
cost
a
drop
of
grecian
blood
the
end
crowns
all
and
that
old
common
arbitrator
time
will
one
day
end
it
ulysses
so
to
him
we
leave
it
most
gentle
and
most
valiant
hector
welcome
after
the
general
i
beseech
you
next
to
feast
with
me
and
see
me
at
my
tent
achilles
i
shall
forestall
thee
lord

more
in

than

st
why
dost
thou
so
oppress
me
with
thine
eye
achilles
tell
me
you
heavens
in
which
part
of
his
body

destroy
him
whether

local
wound
a

very
breach
whereout
hector

great
spirit
flew

me

blest
gods
proud
man

a
question

thou
to

my
life
so
pleasantly

yea
hector
wert
thou
an
oracle
to

by
the
forge
that
stithied
mars

helm
i
ll
kill
thee
every
where
yea
o
er

o
er
you
wisest
grecians

folly
from

act
shall
i
not
lie
in

sith
yet
there
is
a
credence
in

an

so
obstinately
strong
that
doth
invert
the
attest
of

ears
as
if
those
organs
had
deceptious
functions
created
only
to

not
give
advantage
to
stubborn
critics
apt
without
a

for
depravation
to
square
the
general

by

rather
think
this
not
cressid
ulysses
what
hath
she
done
prince
that
can
soil
our

troilus
nothing
