a
heavier
task

my
griefs
unspeakable
yet
that
the
world
may
witness
that
my
end
was
wrought
by
nature
not

offence
i

utter
what
my
sorrows
give
me
leave
in
syracusa
was
i
born
and
wed
unto
a
woman
happy
but
for
me
and
by
me
had
not
our
hap
been
bad
with
her
i
lived
in
joy
our
wealth
increased
by
prosperous
voyages
i
often
made
to
epidamnum
till
my
factor
s
death
and
the
great
care
of
goods
at
random
left
drew
me
from
kind
embracements
of
my
spouse
from
whom
my
absence
was
not
six
months
old
before
herself
almost
at
fainting
under
the
pleasing
punishment
that
women
bear
had
made
provision
for
her
following
me
and
soon
and
safe
arrived
where
i
was
there
had
she
not
been
long
but
she
became
a
joyful
mother
of
two
goodly
sons
and
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
as
could
not
be
distinguish
d
but
by
names
that
very
hour
and
in
the
self
same
inn
a
meaner
woman
was
delivered
of
such
a
burden
male
twins
both
alike
those
for
their
parents
were
exceeding
poor
i
bought
and
brought
up
to
attend
my
sons
my
wife
not
meanly
proud
of
two
such
boys
made
daily
motions
for
our
home
return
unwilling
i
agreed
alas
too
soon
we
came
aboard
a
league
from
epidamnum
had
we
sail
d
before
the
always
wind
obeying
deep
gave
any
tragic
instance
of
our
harm
but
longer
did
we
not
retain
much
hope
for
what
obscured
light
the
heavens
did
grant
did
but
convey
unto
our
fearful
minds
a
doubtful
warrant
of
immediate
death
which
though
myself
would
gladly
have
embraced
yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
and
piteous
plainings
of
the
pretty
babes
that
mourn
d
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
fear
forced
me
to
seek
delays
for
them
and
me
and
this
it
was
for
other
means
was
none
the
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boat
and
left
the
ship
then
sinking
ripe
to
us
my
wife
more
careful
for
the
latter
born
had
fasten
d
him
unto
a
small
spare
mast
such
as
seafaring
men
provide
for
storms
to
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
whilst
i
had
been
like
heedful
of
the
other
the
children
thus
disposed
my
wife
and
i
fixing
our
eyes
on
whom
our
care
was
fix
d
fasten
d
ourselves
at
either
end
the
mast
and
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
stream
was
carried
towards
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
the
sun
gazing
upon
the
earth
dispersed
those
vapours
that
offended
us
and
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
the
seas
wax
d
calm
and
we
discovered
two
ships
from
far
making
amain
to
us
of
corinth
that
of
epidaurus
this
but
ere
they
came
o
let
me
say
no
more
gather
the
sequel
by
that
went
before
duke
solinus
nay
forward
old
man
do
not
break
off
so
for
we
may
pity
though
not
pardon
thee
aegeon
o
had
the
gods
done
so
i
had
not
now
worthily
term
d
them
merciless
to
us
for
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
five
leagues
we
were
encounterd
by
a
mighty
rock
which
being
violently
borne
upon
our
helpful
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
so
that
in
this
unjust
divorce
of
us
fortune
had
left
to
both
of
us
alike
what
to
delight
in
what
to
sorrow
for
her
part
poor
soul
seeming
as
burdened
with
lesser
weight
but
not
with
lesser
woe
was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
wind
and
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
up
by
fishermen
of
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
another
ship
had
seized
on
us
and
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
save
gave
healthful
welcome
to
their
shipwreck
d
guests
and
would
have
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
had
not
their
bark
been
very
slow
of
sail
and
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course
thus
have
you
heard
me
sever
d
from
my
bliss
that
by
misfortunes
was
my
life
prolong
d
to
tell
sad
stories
of
my
own
mishaps

solinus
and
for
the
sake
of
them
thou
sorrowest
for
do
me
the
favour
to
dilate
at
full
what
hath
befall
n
of
them
and
thee
till
now
aegeon
my
youngest
boy
and
yet
my
eldest
care
at
eighteen
years

inquisitive
after

such
a
niggard
of

not
a
man
of

but
he

dealer
the
sooner

he
loseth
it
in

sir
namely

much
different
from
the
man
he
was
but
till
this
afternoon
his
passion
ne
er
brake
into
extremity
of
rage
aemelia
hath
he
not
lost
much
wealth
by
wreck
of
sea
buried
some
dear
friend
hath
not
else
his
eye
stray
d
his
affection
in
unlawful
love
a
sin
prevailing
much
in
youthful
men
who
give
their
eyes
the
liberty
of
gazing
which
of
these
sorrows
is
he
subject
to
adriana
to
none
of
these
except
it
be
the
last
namely
some
love
that
drew
him
oft
from
home
aemelia
you
should
for
that
have
reprehended
him
adriana
why
so
i
did
aemelia
ay
but
not
rough
enough
adriana
as
roughly
as
my
modesty
would
let
me
aemelia
haply
in
private
adriana
and
in
assemblies
too
aemelia
ay
but
not
enough
adriana
it
was
the
copy
of
our
conference
in
bed
he
slept
not
for
my
urging
it
at
board
he
fed
not
for
my
urging
it
alone
it
was
the
subject
of
my
theme
in
company
i
often
glanced
it
still
did
i
tell
him
it
was
vile
and
bad
aemelia
and
thereof
came
it
that
the
man
was
mad
the
venom
clamours
of
a
jealous
woman
poisons
more
deadly
than
a
mad
dog
s
tooth
it
seems
his
sleeps
were
hinder
d
by
thy
railing
and
therefore
comes
it
that
his
head
is
light
thou
say
st
his
meat
was
sauced
with
thy
upbraidings
unquiet
meals
make
ill
digestions
thereof
the
raging
fire
of
fever
bred
and
what
s
a
fever
but
a
fit
of
madness
thou
say
st
his
sports
were
hinderd
by
thy
brawls
sweet
recreation
barr
d
what
doth
ensue
but
moody
and
dull
melancholy
kinsman
to
grim
and
comfortless
despair
and
at
her
heels
a
huge
infectious
troop
of
pale
distemperatures
and
foes
to
life
in
food
in
sport
and
life
preserving
rest
to
be
disturb
d
would
mad
or
man
or
beast
the
consequence
is
then
thy
jealous
fits
have
scared
thy
husband
from
the
use
of
wits
luciana
she
never
reprehended
him
but
mildly
when
he
demean
d
himself
rough
rude
and
wildly
why
bear
you
these
rebukes
and
answer
not
adriana
she
did
betray
me
to
my
own
reproof
good
people
enter
and
lay
hold
on
him
aemelia
no
not
a
creature
enters
in
my
house
adriana
then
let
your
servants
bring
my
husband
forth
aemelia
neither
he
took
this
place
for
sanctuary
and
it
shall
privilege
him
from
your
hands
till
i
have
brought
him
to
his
wits
again
or
lose
my
labour
in
assaying
it
adriana
i
will
attend
my
husband
be
his
nurse
diet
his
sickness
for
it
is
my
office
and
will
have
no
attorney
but
myself
and
therefore
let
me
have
him
home
with
me
aemelia
be
patient
for
i
will
not
let
him
stir
till
i
have
used
the
approved
means
i
have
with
wholesome
syrups
drugs
and
holy
prayers
to
make
of
him
a
formal
man
again
it
is
a
branch
and
parcel
of
mine
oath
a
charitable
duty
of
my
order
therefore
depart
and
leave
him
here
with
me
adriana
i
will
not
hence
and
leave
my
husband
here
and
ill
it
doth
beseem
your
holiness
to
separate
the
husband
and
the
wife
aemelia
be
quiet
and
depart
thou
shalt
not
have
him
exit
luciana
complain
unto
the
duke
of
this
indignity
adriana
come
go
i
will
fall
prostrate
at
his
feet
and
never
rise
until
my
tears
and
prayers
have
won
his
grace
to
come
in
person
hither
and
take
perforce
my
husband
from
the
abbess
second
merchant
by
this
i

himself
in

comes
this
way
to
the
melancholy
vale
the
place
of
death
and
sorry
execution
behind
the
ditches
of
the
abbey
here
angelo
upon
what
cause
second

to
see
a
reverend
syracusian
merchant
who
put
unluckily
into
this
bay
against
the
laws
and
statutes
of
this
town
beheaded
publicly
for
his
offence
angelo

where
they
come

attended

bareheaded
with
the

duke

yet
once
again
proclaim
it
publicly
if
any
friend
will
pay
the
sum
for
him
he
shall
not
die
so
much
we
tender
him
adriana
justice
most
sacred
duke
against
the
abbess
duke
solinus
she
is
a
virtuous
and
a
reverend
lady
it
cannot
be
that
she
hath
done
thee
wrong
adriana
may
it
please
your
grace
antipholus
my
husband
whom
i
made
lord
of
me
and
all
i
had
at
your
important
letters
this
ill
day
a
most
outrageous
fit
of
madness
took
him
that
desperately
he
hurried
through
the
street
with
him
his
bondman
all
as
mad
as
he
doing
displeasure
to
the
citizens
by
rushing
in
their
houses
bearing
thence
rings
jewels
any
thing
his
rage
did
like
once
did
i
get
him
bound
and
sent
him
home
whilst
to
take
order
for
the
wrongs
i
went
that
here
and
there
his
fury
had
committed
anon
i
wot
not
by
what
strong
escape
he
broke
from
those
that
had
the
guard
of
him
and
with
his
mad
attendant
and
himself
each
one
with
ireful
passion
with
drawn
swords
met
us
again
and
madly
bent
on
us
chased
us
away
till
raising
of
more
aid
we
came
again
to
bind
them
then
they
fled
into
this
abbey
whither
we
pursued
them
and
here
the
abbess
shuts
the
gates
on
us
and
will
not
suffer
us
to
fetch
him
out
nor
send
him
forth
that
we
may
bear
him
hence
therefore
most
gracious
duke
with
thy
command
let
him
be
brought
forth
and
borne
hence
for
help

long
since
thy

me
in

and
in
his
company
that
gentleman
there
did
this
perjured
goldsmith
swear
me
down
that
i
this
day
of
him
received
the
chain
which
god
he
knows
i
saw
not
for
the
which
he
did

me
with
an
officer

did
obey
and
sent
my
peasant
home
for
certain
ducats

with
none

then
fairly
i
bespoke
the
officer
to
go
in

with
me
to
my
house
by
the
way
we
met
my
wife
her
sister
and
a
rabble
more
of
vile
confederates
along
with
them
they
brought
one
pinch
a
hungry
lean
faced
villain
a
mere
anatomy
a
mountebank
a
threadbare
juggler
and
a
fortune
teller
a
needy
hollow
eyed
sharp
looking
wretch
a
dead
looking
man
this
pernicious
slave
forsooth
took
on
him
as
a

and
gazing
in

feeling
my

with

then
all
together
they
fell
upon

me
thence
and
in
a
dark
and
dankish
vault
at
home
there
left
me
and
my
man
both
bound
together
till
gnawing
with
my
teeth
my
bonds
in

i
gain
d
my
freedom
and
immediately
ran
hither
to
your

indignities

such
a

be
sworn
these
ears
of

heard
you
confess
you
had
the
chain
of

after
you
first
forswore
it
on
the
mart
and
thereupon
i
drew
my
sword
on
you
and
then
you
fled
into
this
