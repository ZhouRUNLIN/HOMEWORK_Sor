sweet
glances
of
thy
honour
d
love
i
rather
would
entreat
thy
company
to

the
wonders
of
the
world
abroad
than
living
dully
sluggardized
at

wear
out
thy
youth
with
shapeless
idleness
but
since

still
and

that

on
some
shallow
story
of
deep
love
how
young
leander
cross
d
the
hellespont
proteus
that
s
a
deep
story
of
a
deeper
love
for
he
was
more
than
over
shoes
in
love
valentine
tis
true
for
you
are
over
boots
in
love
and
yet
you
never
swum
the
hellespont
proteus
over
the
boots
nay
give
me
not
the
boots
valentine
no
i
will
not
for
it
boots
thee
not
proteus
what
valentine
to
be
in
love
where
scorn
is
bought
with
groans
coy
looks
with
heart
sore
sighs
one
fading
moment
s
mirth
with
twenty
watchful
weary
tedious
nights
if
haply
won
perhaps
a
hapless
gain
if
lost
why
then
a
grievous
labour
won
however
but
a
folly
bought
with
wit
or
else
a
wit
by
folly
vanquished
proteus
so
by
your
circumstance
you
call
me
fool
valentine
so
by
your
circumstance
i
fear
you
ll
prove
proteus
tis
love
you
cavil
at
i
am
not
love
valentine
love
is
your
master
for
he
masters
you
and
he
that
is
so
yoked
by
a
fool
methinks
should
not
be
chronicled
for
wise
proteus
yet
writers
say
as
in
the
sweetest
bud
the
eating
canker
dwells
so
eating
love
inhabits
in
the
finest
wits
of
all
valentine
and
writers
say
as
the
most
forward
bud
is
eaten
by
the
canker
ere
it
blow
even
so
by
love
the
young
and
tender
wit
is
turn
d
to
folly
blasting
in
the
bud
losing
his
verdure
even
in
the
prime
and
all
the
fair
effects
of
future
hopes
but
wherefore
waste
i
time
to
counsel
thee
that
art
a
votary
to
fond
desire
once
more
adieu
my
father
at
the
road

more
i
leave
myself
my
friends
and
all
for

thou
julia
thou
hast
metamorphosed
me
made
me
neglect
my
studies
lose
my
time
war
with
good
counsel
set
the
world
at
nought
made
wit
with
musing
weak
heart
sick
with
thought
enter
speed
speed
sir
proteus
save
you
saw
you
my
master
proteus
but
now
he
parted
hence
to
embark
for
milan
speed
twenty
to
one
then
he
is
shipp
d
already
and
i
have
play
d
the
sheep
in
losing
him
proteus
indeed
a
sheep
doth
very
often
stray
an
if
the
shepherd
be
a
while
away
speed
you
conclude
that
my
master
is
a
shepherd
then
and
i
a
sheep
proteus
i
do
speed
why
then
my
horns
are
his
horns
whether
i
wake
or
sleep
proteus
a
silly
answer
and
fitting
well
a
sheep
speed
this
proves
me
still
a
sheep
proteus
true
and
thy
master
a
shepherd
speed
nay
that
i
can
deny
by
a
circumstance
proteus
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
ll
prove
it
by
another
speed
the
shepherd
seeks
the
sheep
and
not
the
sheep
the
shepherd
but
i
seek
my
master
and
my
master
seeks
not
me
therefore
i
am
no
sheep
proteus
the
sheep
for
fodder
follow
the
shepherd
the
shepherd
for
food
follows
not
the
sheep
thou
for
wages
followest
thy
master
thy
master
for
wages
follows
not
thee
therefore
thou
art
a
sheep
speed
such
another
proof
will
make
me
cry
baa
proteus
but
dost
thou
hear
gavest
thou
my
letter
to
julia
speed
ay
sir
i
a
lost
mutton
gave
your
letter
to
her
a
laced
mutton
and
she
a
laced
mutton
gave
me
a
lost
mutton
nothing
for
my
labour
proteus
here
s
too
small
a
pasture
for
such
store
of
muttons
speed
if
the
ground
be
overcharged
you
were
best
stick
her
proteus
nay
in
that
you
are
astray
twere
best
pound
you
speed
nay
sir
less
than
a
pound
shall
serve
me
for
carrying
your
letter
proteus
you
mistake
i
mean
the
pound
a
pinfold
speed
from
a
pound
to
a
pin
fold
it
over
and
over
tis
threefold
too
little
for
carrying
a
letter
to
your
lover
proteus
but
what
said
she
speed
[first
nodding]
ay
proteus
nod
ay
why
that
s
noddy
speed
you
mistook
sir
i
say
she
did
nod
and
you
ask
me
if
she
did
nod
and
i
say
ay
proteus
and
that
set
together
is
noddy
speed
now
you
have
taken
the
pains
to
set
it
together
take
it
for
your
pains
proteus
no
no
you
shall
have
it
for
bearing
the
letter
speed
well
i
perceive
i
must
be
fain
to
bear
with
you
proteus
why
sir
how
do
you
bear
with
me
speed
marry
sir
the
letter
very
orderly
having
nothing
but
the
word
noddy
for
my
pains
proteus
beshrew
me
but
you
have
a
quick
wit
speed
and
yet
it
cannot
overtake
your
slow
purse
proteus
come
come
open
the
matter
in
brief
what
said
she
speed
open
your
purse
that
the
money
and
the
matter
may
be
both
at
once
delivered
proteus
well
sir
here
is
for
your
pains
what
said
she
speed
truly
sir
i
think
you
ll
hardly
win
her
proteus
why
couldst
thou
perceive
so
much
from
her
speed
sir
i
could
perceive
nothing
at
all
from
her
no
not
so
much
as
a
ducat
for
delivering
your
letter
and
being
so
hard
to
me
that
brought
your
mind
i
fear
she
ll
prove
as
hard
to
you
in
telling
your
mind
give
her
no
token
but
stones
for
she
s
as
hard
as
steel
proteus
what
said
she
nothing
speed
no
not
so
much
as
take
this
for
thy
pains
to
testify
your
bounty
i
thank
you
you
have
testerned
me
in
requital
whereof
henceforth
carry
your
letters
yourself
and
so
sir
i
ll
commend
you
to
my
master
proteus
go
go
be
gone
to
save
your
ship
from
wreck
which
cannot
perish
having
thee
aboard
being
destined
to
a
drier
death
on
shore
exit
speed
i
must
go

better
messenger

julia
would
not
deign
my
lines

a
worthless
post

ii
the

garden
of
julia

house

julla
and
lucetta
julia
but
say
lucetta
now
we
are
alone
wouldst
thou
then
counsel
me
to
fall
in
love
lucetta
ay
madam
so
you
stumble
not
unheedfully
julia
of
all
the
fair
resort
of
gentlemen
that
every
day
with
parle
encounter
me
in
thy
opinion
which
is
worthiest
love
lucetta
please
you
repeat
their
names
i
ll
show
my
mind
according
to
my
shallow
simple
skill
julia
what
think
st
thou
of
the
fair
sir
eglamour
lucetta
as
of
a
knight
well
spoken
neat
and
fine
but
were
i
you
he
never
should
be
mine
julia
what
think
st
thou
of
the
rich
mercatio
lucetta
well
of
his
wealth
but
of
himself
so
so
julia
what
think
st
thou
of
the
gentle
proteus
lucetta
lord
lord
to
see
what
folly
reigns
in
us
julia
how
now
what
means
this
passion
at
his
name
lucetta
pardon
dear
madam
tis
a
passing
shame
that
i
unworthy
body
as
i
am
should
censure
thus
on
lovely
gentlemen
julia
why
not
on
proteus
as
of
all
the
rest
lucetta
then
thus
of
many
good
i
think
him
best
julia
your
reason
lucetta
i
have
no
other
but
a
woman
s
reason
i
think
him
so
because
i
think
him
so
julia
and
wouldst
thou
have
me
cast
my
love
on
him
lucetta
ay
if
you
thought
your
love
not
cast
away
julia
why
he
of
all
the
rest
hath
never
moved
me
lucetta
yet
he
of
all
the
rest
i
think
best
loves
ye
julia
his
little
speaking
shows
his
love
but
small
lucetta
fire
that
s
closest
kept
burns
most
of
all
julia
they
do
not
love
that
do
not
show
their
love
lucetta
o
they
love
least
that
let
men
know
their
love
julia
i
would
i
knew
his
mind
lucetta
peruse
this
paper
madam
julia
to
julia
say
from
whom
lucetta
that
the
contents
will
show
julia
say
say
who
gave
it
thee
lucetta
valentine
s
page
and
sent
i
think
from
proteus
he
would
have
given
it
you
but
i
being
in
the
way
did
in
your
name
receive
it
pardon
the
fault
i
pray
julia
now
by
my
modesty
a
goodly
broker
dare
you
presume
to
harbour
wanton
lines
to
whisper
and
conspire
against
my
youth
now
trust
me
tis
an
office
of
great
worth
and
you
an
officer
fit
for
the
place
or
else
return
no
more
into
my
sight
lucetta
to
plead
for
love
deserves
more
fee
than
hate
julia
will
ye
be
gone
lucetta
that
you
may
ruminate
exit
julia
and
yet
i
would
i
had
o
erlooked
the
letter
it
were
a
shame
to
call
her
back
again
and
pray
her
to
a
fault
for
which
i
chid
her
what
a
fool
is
she
that
knows
i
am
a
maid
and
would
not
force
the
letter
to
my
view
since
maids
in
modesty
say
no
to
that
which
they
would
have
the
profferer
construe
ay
fie
fie
how
wayward
is
this
foolish
love
that
like
a
testy
babe
will
scratch
the
nurse
and
presently
all
humbled
kiss
the
rod
how
churlishly
i
chid
lucetta
hence
when
willingly
i
would
have
had
her
here
how
angerly
i
taught
my
brow
to
frown
when
inward
joy
enforced
my
heart
to
smile
my
penance
is
to
call
lucetta
back
and
ask
remission
for
my
folly
past
what
ho
lucetta
re
enter
lucetta
lucetta
what
would
your
ladyship
julia
is
t
near
dinner
time
lucetta
i
would
it
were
that
you
might
kill
your
stomach
on
your
meat
and
not
upon
your
maid
julia
what
is
t
that
you
took
up
so
gingerly
lucetta
nothing
julia
why
didst
thou
stoop
then
lucetta
to
take
a
paper
up
that
i
let
fall
julia
and
is
that
paper
nothing
lucetta
nothing
concerning
me
julia
then
let
it
lie
for
those
that
it
concerns
lucetta
madam
it
will
not
lie
where
it
concerns
unless
it
have
a
false
interpeter
julia
some
love
of
yours
hath
writ
to
you
in
rhyme
lucetta
that
i
might
sing
it
madam
to
a
tune
give
me
a
note
your
ladyship
can
set
julia
as
little
by
such
toys
as
may
be
possible
best
sing
it
to
the
tune
of
light
o
love
lucetta
it
is
too
heavy
for
so
light
a
tune
julia
heavy
belike
it
hath
some
burden
then
lucetta
ay
and
melodious
were
it
would
you
sing
it
julia
and
why
not
you
lucetta
i
cannot
reach
so
high
julia
let
s
see
your
song
how
now
minion
lucetta
keep
tune
there
still
so
you
will
sing
it
out
and
yet

i
do
not
like
this
tune
julia

not
lucetta

is
too
sharp
julia
you
minion
are

saucy

too
flat
and
mar
the
concord
with
too
harsh
a
descant
there
wanteth
but
a
mean
to
fill
your
song
julia
the
mean
is

your
unruly
bass

sir
proteus
to
wreathe
your
arms
like
a
malecontent
to
relish
a
love
song
like
a
robin
redbreast
to
walk
alone
like
one
that
had
the
pestilence
to
sigh
like
a
school
boy
that
had
lost
his
a
b
c
to
weep
like
a
young
wench
that
had
buried
her
grandam
to
fast
like
one
that
takes
diet
to
watch
like
one
that
fears
robbing
to
speak
puling
like
a
beggar
at
hallowmas
you
were
wont
when
you
laughed
to
crow
like
a
cock
when
you
walked
to
walk
like
one
of
the
lions
when
you
fasted
it
was
presently
after
dinner
when
you
looked
sadly
it
was
for
want
of
money
and
now
you
are
metamorphosed
with
a
mistress
that
when
i
look
on
you
i
can
hardly
think
you
my
master
valentine
are
all
these
things
perceived
in
me
speed
they
are
all
perceived
without
ye
valentine
without
me
they
cannot
speed
without
you
nay
that
s
certain
for
without
you
were
so
simple
none
else
would
but
you
are
so
without
these
follies
that
these
follies
are
within
you
and
shine
through
you
like
the
water
in
an
urinal
that
not
an
eye
that
sees
you
but
is
a
physician
to
comment
on
your
malady
valentine
but
tell
me
dost
thou
know
my
lady
silvia
speed
she
that
you
gaze
on
so
as
she
sits
at
supper
valentine
hast
thou
observed
that
even
she
i
mean
speed
why
sir
i
know
her
not
valentine
dost
thou
know
her
by
my
gazing
on
her
and
yet
knowest
her
not
speed
is
she
not
hard
favoured
sir
valentine
not
so
fair
boy
as
well
favoured
speed
sir
i
know
that
well
enough
valentine
what
dost
thou
know
speed
that
she
is
not
so
fair
as
of
you
well
favoured
valentine
i
mean
that
her
beauty
is
exquisite
but
her
favour
infinite
speed
that
s
because
the
one
is
painted
and
the
other
out
of
all
count
valentine
how
painted
and
how
out
of
count
speed
marry
sir
so
painted
to
make
her
fair
that
no
man
counts
of
her
beauty
valentine
how
esteemest
thou
me
i
account
of
her
beauty
speed
you
never
saw
her
since
she
was
deformed
valentine

long
hath
she
been
deformed
speed
ever
since
you
loved
her
valentine
i

loved
her
ever

i
saw
her
and
still
i
see
her
beautiful
speed
if
you
love
her
you
cannot
see
her
valentine
why
speed
because
love
is
blind
o
that
you

mine
eyes
or
your

eyes

the
lights
they
were
wont
to
have
when

at
sir
proteus
for

passing
deformity

to
put
on
your

like
perfection
yet
hath
sir
proteus
for
that
s
his

made
use
and
fair
advantage
of
his
days
his
years
but
young
but
his
experience
old
his
head
unmellow
d
but
his
judgment
ripe
and
in
a
word
for
far
behind
his

comes
all
the

with

other
pawn

ay
proteus
but
that
life
is
alter
d
now
i
have
done
penance
for
contemning
love
whose
high
imperious
thoughts
have
punish
d
me
with
bitter
fasts
with
penitential
groans
with
nightly
tears

daily
heart
sore
sighs

in
revenge
of
my
contempt
of

made
them
watchers
of
mine
own
heart

sorrow

a
mighty

hath
so
humbled

no
woe
to
his
correction
nor
to
his
service
no
such
joy
on
earth
now
no
discourse
except
it
be
of
love
now
can
i
break
my
fast
dine
sup
and
sleep
upon
the
very
naked
name
of
love
proteus
enough
i
read
your
fortune
in
your
eye
was
this
the
idol
that
you
worship
so
valentine
even
she
and
is
she
not
a
heavenly
saint
proteus
no
but
she
is
an
earthly
paragon
valentine
call
her
divine
proteus
i
will
not
flatter
her
valentine
o
flatter
me
for
love
delights
in
praises
proteus
when
i
was
sick
you
gave
me
bitter
pills
and
i
must
minister
the
like
to
you
valentine
then
speak
the
truth
by
her
if
not
divine
yet
let
her
be
a
principality
sovereign
to
all
the
creatures
on
the
earth
proteus
except
my
mistress
valentine
sweet
except
not
any
except
thou
wilt
except
against
my
love
proteus
have
i
not
reason
to
prefer
mine
own
valentine
and
i
will
help
thee
to
prefer
her
too
she
shall
be
dignified
with
this
high
honour
to
bear
my
lady
s
train
lest
the
base
earth
should
from
her
vesture
chance
to
steal
a
kiss
and
of
so
great
a
favour
growing
proud
disdain
to
root
the
summer
swelling
flower
and
make
rough
winter
everlastingly
proteus
why
valentine
what
braggardism
is
this
valentine
pardon
me
proteus
all
i
can
is
nothing
to
her
whose
worth
makes
other
worthies
nothing
she
is
alone
proteus
then
let
her
alone
valentine
not
for
the
world
why
man
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sand
were
pearl
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure
gold
forgive
me
that
i
do
not
dream
on
thee
because
thou
see
st
me
dote
upon
my
love
my
foolish
rival
that
her
father
likes
only
for
his
possessions
are
so
huge
is
gone
with
her
along
and
i
must
after
for
love
thou
know
st
is
full
of
jealousy
proteus
but
she
loves
you
valentine
ay
and
we
are
betroth
d
nay
more
our
marriage
hour
with
all
the
cunning
manner
of
our
flight
determined
of
how
i
must
climb
her
window
the
ladder
made
of
cords
and
all
the
means
plotted
and
greed
on
for
my
happiness
good
proteus
go
with
me
to
my
chamber
in
these
affairs
to
aid
me
with
thy
counsel
proteus
go
on
before
i
shall
inquire
you
forth
i
must
unto
the
road
to
disembark
some
necessaries
that
i
needs
must
use
and
then
i
ll
presently
attend
you
valentine
will
you
make
haste
proteus
i
will
exit
valentine
even
as
one
heat
another
heat
expels
or
as
one
nail
by
strength
drives
out
another
so
the
remembrance
of
my
former
love
is
by
a
newer
object
quite
forgotten
is
it
mine
or
valentine
s
praise
her
true
perfection
or
my
false
transgression
that
makes
me
reasonless
to
reason
thus
she
is
fair
and
so
is
julia
that
i
love
that
i
did
love
for
now
my
love
is
thaw
d
which
like
a
waxen
image
gainst
a
fire
bears
no
impression
of
the
thing
it
was
methinks
my
zeal
to
valentine
is
cold
and
that
i
love
him
not
as
i
was
wont
o
but
i
love
his
lady
too
too
much
and
that
s
the
reason
i
love
him
so
little
how
shall
i
dote
on
her
with
more
advice
that
thus
without
advice
begin
to
love
her
tis
but
her
picture
i
have
yet
beheld
and
that
hath
dazzled
my
reason
s
light
but
when
i
look
on
her
perfections
there
is
no
reason
but
i
shall
be
blind
if
i
can
cheque
my
erring
love
i
will
if
not
to
compass
her
i
ll
use
my
skill
exit

launce
by
mine
honesty
welcome
to

forswear
not
thyself
sweet
youth
for
i
am
not
welcome
i
reckon
this
always
that
a
man
is
never
undone
till
he
be
hanged
nor
never
welcome
to
a
place
till
some
certain
shot
be
paid
and
the
hostess
say
welcome
speed
come
on
you
madcap
i
ll
to
the
alehouse
with
you
presently
where
for
one
shot
of
five
pence
thou
shalt
have
five
thousand
welcomes

sirrah
how
did
thy
master
part
with
madam
julia
launce
marry
after
they
closed
in

they
parted
very
fairly
in
jest
speed
but
shall
she
marry
him
launce
no
speed
how
then
shall
he
marry
her
launce
no
neither
speed
what
are
they
broken
launce
no
they
are
both
as
whole
as
a
fish
speed
why
then
how
stands
the
matter
with
them
launce
marry
thus
when
it
stands
well
with
him
it
stands
well
with
her
speed
what
an
ass
art
thou
i
understand
thee
not
launce
what
a
block
art
thou
that
thou
canst
not
my

understands
me
speed
what
thou
sayest
launce
ay
and
what
i

too
look
thee

lean
and
my

it
stands
under
thee
indeed

ay
it
will
if
he
say
no
it
will
if
he
shake
his

the
conclusion
is
then
that
it
will
launce
thou
shalt
never
get
such
a
secret
from

but
by
a
parable
speed
tis

thou
art
an
hebrew
a

thou
hast
not

truer

his

are
oracles
his

sincere
his

immaculate
his

sent
from

his

me
on

night
intends
to
steal
away

the
plot

determined
to
bestow
her
on
thurio
whom
your
gentle
daughter
hates
and
should
she
thus
be
stol
n
away
from

it
would
be
much
vexation
to
your
age
thus
for
my
duty

sake
i
rather
chose
to
cross
my
friend
in
his
intended
drift
than
by
concealing
it
heap
on
your
head
a
pack
of
sorrows
which
would
press
you
down

unprevented
to
your
timeless
grave
duke

thank
thee
for
thine
honest

live
this
love
of
theirs
myself
have
often
seen
haply
when
they
have
judged
me
fast
asleep
and
oftentimes
have
purposed
to
forbid
sir
valentine
her
company
and
my
court
but
fearing
lest
my
jealous
aim
might
err
and
so
unworthily
disgrace
the
man
a
rashness
that
i
ever
yet
have
shunn
d
i
gave
him
gentle
looks
thereby
to
find
that
which
thyself
hast
now
disclosed
to
me
and
that
thou
mayst
perceive
my
fear
of
this
knowing
that
tender
youth
is
soon
suggested
i
nightly
lodge
her
in
an
upper
tower
the
key
whereof
myself
have
ever
kept
and
thence
she
cannot
be
convey
d
away
proteus
know
noble
lord
they
have
devised
a
mean
how
he
her
chamber
window
will
ascend
and
with
a
corded
ladder
fetch
her
down
for
which
the
youthful
lover
now
is
gone
and
this
way
comes
he
with
it
presently
where
if
it
please
you
you
may
intercept
him
but
good
my
lord

it
so
cunningly
that
my
discovery
be
not
aimed
at
for
love
of
you
not
hate
unto
my
friend
hath
made
me
publisher
of
this
pretence
duke
upon
mine
honour

had
any
light
from
thee
of
this
proteus
adieu

my
letters
to
my
friends

am
going
to
deliver

of
much
import

signify
my
health
and
happy
being
at
your
court
duke
nay
then
no
matter
stay
with
me
awhile

am
to
break
with
thee
of
some
affairs
that
touch
me
near
wherein
thou
must
be
secret
tis
not
unknown
to
thee
that
i
have
sought
to
match
my
friend
sir
thurio
to
my
daughter
valentine
i
know
it
well
my
lord
and
sure
the
match
were
rich
and
honourable
besides
the
gentleman
is
full
of
virtue
bounty
worth
and
qualities
beseeming
such
a
wife
as
your
fair
daughter
cannot
your
grace
win
her
to
fancy
him
duke
no
trust
me
she
is
peevish
sullen
froward
proud
disobedient
stubborn
lacking
duty
neither
regarding
that
she
is
my
child
nor
fearing
me
as
if
i
were
her
father
and
may
i
say
to
thee
this
pride
of
hers
upon
advice
hath
drawn
my
love
from
her
and
where
i
thought
the
remnant
of
mine
age
should
have
been
cherish
d
by
her
child
like
duty
i
now
am
full
resolved
to
take
a
wife
and
turn
her
out
to
who
will
take
her
in
then
let
her
beauty
be
her
wedding
dower
for
me
and
my
possessions
she
esteems
not
valentine
what
would
your
grace
have
me
to
do
in
this
duke
there
is
a
lady
in
verona
here
whom
i
affect
but
she
is
nice
and
coy
and
nought
esteems
my
aged
eloquence
now
therefore
would
i
have
thee
to
my
tutor
for
long
agone
i
have
forgot
to
court
besides
the
fashion
of
the
time
is
changed
how
and
which
way
i
may
bestow
myself
to
be
regarded
in
her
sun
bright
eye
valentine
win
her
with
gifts
if
she
respect
not
words
dumb
jewels
often
in
their
silent
kind
more
than
quick
words
do
move
a
woman
s
mind
duke
but
she
did
scorn
a
present
that
i
sent
her
valentine
a
woman
sometimes
scorns
what
best
contents
her
send
her
another
never
give
her
o
er
for
scorn
at
first
makes
after
love
the
more
if
she
do
frown
tis
not
in
hate
of
you
but
rather
to
beget
more
love
in
you
if
she
do
chide
tis
not
to
have
you
gone
for
why
the
fools
are
mad
if
left
alone
take
no
repulse
whatever
she
doth
say
for
get
you
gone
she
doth
not
mean
away
flatter
and
praise
commend
extol
their
graces
though
ne
er
so
black
say
they
have
angels
faces
that
man
that
hath
a
tongue
i
say
is
no
man
if
with
his
tongue
he
cannot
win
a
woman
duke
but
she
i
mean
is
promised
by
her
friends
unto
a
youthful
gentleman
of
worth
and
kept
severely
from
resort
of
men
that
no
man
hath
access
by
day
to
her
valentine
why
then
i
would
resort
to
her
by
night
duke
ay
but
the
doors
be
lock
d
and
keys
kept
safe
that
no
man
hath
recourse
to
her
by
night
valentine
what
lets
but
one
may
enter
at
her
window
duke
her
chamber
is
aloft
far
from
the
ground
and
built
so
shelving
that
one
cannot
climb
it
without
apparent
hazard
of
his
life
valentine
why
then
a
ladder
quaintly
made
of
cords
to
cast
up
with
a
pair
of
anchoring
hooks
would
serve
to
scale
another
hero
s
tower
so
bold
leander
would
adventure
it
duke
now
as
thou
art
a
gentleman
of
blood
advise
me
where
i
may
have
such
a
ladder
valentine
when
would
you
use
it
pray
sir
tell
me
that
duke
this
very
night
for

is
like
a
child
that

for
every
thing

come

seven
o
clock
i

get
you

you
may
bear
it
under
a
cloak

fashion
me
to
wear

are
to
me
that

their

they
are
sent
by

that
they

harbour
where
their
lord
would
be
what

here
silvia
this
night
i
will
enfranchise
thee

the
purpose
why

for
thou
art

thou
aspire
to

duke
sir
thurio
fear
not
but
that
she
will
love
you
now
valentine
is
banish
d
from
her
sight
thurio
since
his
exile
she
hath
despised
me
most
forsworn
my
company
and
rail
d
at
me
that
i
am
desperate
of
obtaining
her
duke
this
weak
impress
of
love
is
as
a
figure
trenched
in
ice
which
with
an
hour
s
heat
dissolves
to
water
and
doth
lose
his
form
a
little
time
will
melt
her
frozen
thoughts
and
worthless
valentine
shall
be
forgot
enter
proteus
how
now
sir
proteus
is
your
countryman
according
to
our
proclamation
gone
proteus
gone
my
good
lord
duke
my
daughter
takes
his
going
grievously
proteus
a
little
time
my
lord
will
kill
that
grief
duke
so
i
believe
but
thurio
thinks
not
so
proteus
the
good
conceit
i
hold
of
thee
for
thou
hast
shown
some
sign
of
good
desert
makes
me
the
better
to
confer
with
thee
proteus
longer
than
i
prove
loyal
to
your
grace
let
me
not
live
to
look
upon
your
grace
duke
thou
know
st
how
willingly
i
would
effect
the
match
between
sir
thurio
and
my
daughter
proteus
i
do
my
lord
duke
and
also
i
think
thou
art
not
ignorant
how
she
opposes
her
against
my
will
proteus
she
did
my
lord
when
valentine
was
here
duke
ay
and
perversely
she
persevers
so
what
might
we
do
to
make
the
girl
forget
the
love
of
valentine
and
love
sir
thurio
proteus
the
best
way
is
to
slander
valentine
with
falsehood
cowardice
and
poor
descent
three
things
that
women
highly
hold
in
hate
duke
ay
but
she
ll
think
that
it
is
spoke
in
hate
proteus
ay
if
his
enemy
deliver
it
therefore
it
must
with
circumstance
be
spoken
by
one
whom
she
esteemeth
as
his
friend
duke
then
you
must
undertake
to
slander
him
proteus
and
that
my
lord
i
shall
be
loath
to
do
tis
an
ill
office
for
a
gentleman
especially
against
his
very
friend
duke
where
your
good
word
cannot
advantage
him
your
slander
never
can
endamage
him
therefore
the
office
is
indifferent
being
entreated
to
it
by
your
friend
proteus
you
have
prevail
d
my
lord
if
i
can
do
it
by
ought
that
i
can
speak
in
his
dispraise
she
shall
not
long
continue
love
to
him
but
say
this
weed
her
love
from
valentine
it
follows
not
that
she
will
love
sir
thurio
thurio
therefore
as
you
unwind
her
love
from
him
lest
it
should
ravel
and
be
good
to
none
you
must
provide
to
bottom
it
on
me
which
must
be
done
by
praising
me
as
much
as
you
in
worth
dispraise
sir
valentine
duke
and
proteus
we
dare
trust
you
in
this
kind
because
we
know
on
valentine
s
report
you
are
already
love
s
firm
votary
and
cannot
soon
revolt
and
change
your
mind
upon
this
warrant
shall
you
have
access
where
you
with
silvia
may
confer
at
large
for
she
is
lumpish
heavy
melancholy
and
for
your
friend
s
sake
will
be
glad
of
you
where
you
may
temper
her
by
your
persuasion
to
hate
young
valentine
and
love
my
friend
proteus
as
much
as
i
can
do
i
will
effect
but
you
sir
thurio
are
not
sharp
enough
you
must
lay
lime
to
tangle
her
desires
by
wailful
sonnets
whose
composed
rhymes
should
be
full
fraught
with
serviceable
vows
duke
ay
much
is
the
force
of
heaven
bred
poesy
proteus
say
that
upon
the
altar
of
her
beauty
you
sacrifice
your
tears
your
sighs
your
heart
write
till
your
ink
be
dry
and
with
your
tears
moist
it
again
and
frame
some
feeling
line
that
may
discover

is
when

did
think
my
master
loved
her
well

in

judgment
was
as
fair
as
you
but
since
she
did
neglect
her
looking
glass
and
threw
her
sun
expelling
mask
away
the
air
hath
starved
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
and
pinch
d
the
lily
tincture
of
her
face
that
now
she
is
become
as
black
as
i
silvia
how
tall
was
she
julia
about
my
stature
for
at
pentecost
when
all
our
pageants
of
delight
were
play
d
our
youth
got
me
to
play
the
woman
s
part
and
i
was
trimm
d
in
madam
julia
s
gown
which
served
me
as
fit
by
all
men
s
judgments
as
if
the
garment
had
been
made
for
me
therefore
i
know
she
is
about
my
height
and
at
that
time
i
made
her
weep
agood
for
i
did
play
a
lamentable
part
madam
twas
ariadne
passioning
for
theseus
perjury
and
unjust
flight
which
i
so
lively
acted
with
my
tears
that
my
poor
mistress
moved
therewithal
wept
bitterly
and
would
i
might
be
dead
if
i
in
thought
felt
not
her
very
sorrow
silvia
she
is
beholding
to
thee
gentle
youth
alas
poor
lady
desolate
and
left
i
weep
myself
to
think
upon
thy
words
here
youth
there
is
my
purse
i
give
thee
this
for
thy
sweet
mistress
sake
because
thou
lovest
her
farewell
exit

with
attendants
julia
and
she
shall
thank
you
for
t
if
e
er
you
know
her
a
virtuous
gentlewoman
mild
and
beautiful
i
hope
my
master
s
suit
will
be
but
cold
since
she
respects
my
mistress
love
so
much
alas
how
love
can
trifle
with
itself
here
is
her
picture
let
me
see
i
think
if
i
had
such
a
tire
this
face
of
mine
were
full
as
lovely
as
is
this
of
hers
and
yet
the
painter
flatter
d
her
a
little
unless
i
flatter
with
myself
too
much
her
hair
is
auburn
mine
is
perfect
yellow
if
that
be
all
the
difference
in
his
love
i
ll
get
me
such
a
colour
d
periwig
her
eyes
are
grey
as
glass
and
so
are
mine
ay
but
her
forehead
s
low
and
mine
s
as
high
what
should
it
be
that
he
respects
in
her
but
i
can
make
respective
in
myself
if
this
fond
love
were
not
a
blinded
god
come
shadow
come
and
take
this
shadow
up
for
tis
thy
rival
o
thou
senseless
form
thou
shalt
be
worshipp
d
kiss
d
loved
and
adored
and
were
there
sense
in
his
idolatry
my
substance
should
be
statue
in
thy
stead
i
ll
use
thee
kindly
for
thy
mistress
sake
that
used
me
so
or
else
by
jove
i

i
should
have
