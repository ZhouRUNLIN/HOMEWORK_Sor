and
hope
both
teaching
him
the
practise
to
a
strong
mast
that

upon
the
sea
where
like
arion
on
the
dolphin

back
i
saw
him
hold
acquaintance
with
the
waves
so
long
as

so
very
late
for
but
a
month

i
went
from

and
then
twas
fresh
in
murmur
as
you
know
what
great

prattle
of

did
seek
the
love
of

she
captain
a
virtuous
maid
the
daughter
of

the
protection
of
his
son
her
brother

shortly
also
died

dear
love
they
say
she
hath
abjured
the
company
and
sight
of
men
viola
o
that
i
served
that

delivered
to
the
world

is
a
fair
behavior
in
thee

though
that
nature
with
a
beauteous
wall
doth
oft
close
in
pollution

of
thee

and
outward
character

present
me
as
an
eunuch
to
him

may
be
worth
thy
pains
for

can
sing
and
speak
to
him
in
many
sorts
of
music
that
will
allow

very
worth

limits
of

confine

these

an
they

not
let

in

you
i

yesterday
and
of
a
foolish
knight
that
you
brought

night
here
to
be
her
wooer
sir
toby
belch
who
sir
andrew
aguecheek
maria
ay
he
sir
toby
belch
he

as
tall
a
man
as
any
s
in
illyria
maria
what
s
that
to
the
purpose
sir
toby
belch
why

has
three
thousand
ducats
a

maria
ay
but

of

hath
indeed
almost
natural
for
besides

s
a
fool

hath
the
gift
of
a
coward

thought
among

prudent
he
would
quickly
have
the
gift

touch
of
modesty

rather
to

i
called

sebastian
of
messaline

heard
of
he
left
behind
him
myself
and
a
sister
both
born
in
an
hour
if
the
heavens
had
been
pleased
would
we
had
so
ended
but
you

altered
that
for
some
hour
before
you
took
me
from
the
breach
of
the
sea
was
my
sister
drowned
antonio
alas
the
day
sebastian

that
piece
of
song
that
old
and
antique
song
we
heard
last
night
methought
it
did
relieve
my
passion
much
more
than
light
airs
and
recollected
terms
of

most
brisk
and
giddy
paced
times

else
save
in
the
constant
image
of
the
creature
that
is
beloved
how
dost
thou
like
this
tune
viola
it
gives
a
very
echo
to
the
seat
where
love
is
throned
duke
orsino
thou
dost
speak
masterly
my
life
upon
t

however
we

more
longing
wavering
sooner
lost

worn
than

well
my
lord

younger

bent

as
roses
whose
fair
flower
being
once

d
doth
fall
that
very
hour

big
to
hold
so
much
they
lack
retention
alas
their
love
may
be
call
d
appetite
no
motion
of
the
liver
but
the
palate
that
suffer
surfeit
cloyment
and
revolt
but
mine
is
all
as
hungry
as
the
sea
and
can
digest
as
much
make
no

a

like
a
worm
i
the
bud
feed
on
her
damask
cheek
she
pined
in
thought
and
with
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
she
sat
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
was
not
this
love
indeed
we
men
may
say
more
swear
more
but
indeed
our
shows
are
more
than

much
in

and
thus
makes

it
is
in
contempt
of

sir
andrew
her
c
s
her
u

and
her
t
s
why
that
malvolio
[reads]
to
the
unknown
beloved
this
and
my
good
wishes

very
phrases
by

my

to
whom
should
this
be

this
wins
him

and
all
malvolio
[reads]
jove
knows
i
love
but
who

no

altered
no
man
must
know
if
this
should
be

malvolio
sir
toby
belch
marry
hang
thee
brock
malvolio
[reads]
i
may
command
where
i
adore
but
silence
like
a
lucrece
knife
with
bloodless
stroke
my
heart
doth
gore
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
fabian
a
fustian
riddle
sir
toby
belch
excellent
wench
say
i
malvolio
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
nay
but
first
let
me
see
let
me
see
let
me
see
fabian
what
dish
o
poison
has
she
dressed
him
sir
toby
belch
and
with
what
wing
the
staniel
cheques
at
it
malvolio
i
may
command
where
i
adore
why
she
may
command
me
i
serve
her
she
is
my
lady
why
this
is
evident
to
any
formal
capacity
there
is
no
obstruction
in
this
and
the
end
what
should
that
alphabetical
position
portend
if
i
could
make
that
resemble
something
in
me
softly
m
o
a
i
sir
toby
belch
o
ay
make
up
that
he
is
now
at
a
cold
scent
fabian
sowter
will
cry
upon
t
for
all
this
though
it
be
as
rank
as
a
fox
malvolio
m
malvolio
m
why
that
begins
my
name
fabian
did
not
i
say
he
would
work
it
out
the
cur
is
excellent
at
faults
malvolio
m
but
then
there
is
no
consonancy
in
the
sequel
that
suffers
under
probation
a
should
follow
but
o
does
fabian
and
o
shall
end
i
hope
sir
toby
belch
ay
or
i
ll
cudgel
him
and
make
him
cry
o
malvolio
and
then
i
comes
behind
fabian
ay
an
you
had
any
eye
behind
you
you
might
see
more
detraction
at
your
heels
than
fortunes
before
you
malvolio
m
o
a
i
this
simulation
is
not
as
the
former
and
yet
to
crush
this
a
little
it
would
bow
to
me
for
every
one
of
these
letters

thy
tongue
tang
arguments
of

put
thyself
into
the
trick
of
singularity
she
thus
advises
thee
that
sighs
for
thee
remember
who
commended
thy
yellow
stockings
and
wished
to
see
thee
ever
cross
gartered

fellow
of

not
now
fool
myself
to
let
imagination
jade
me
for
every
reason
excites
to
this
that
my
lady
loves
me
she
did
commend
my
yellow
stockings
of
late
she
did
praise
my
leg
being
cross
gartered
and
in
this
she
manifests
herself
to
my
love
and
with
a
kind
of
injunction
drives
me
to
these
habits
of
her
liking
i
thank
my
stars
i
am
happy
i
will
be
strange
stout
in
yellow
stockings
and
cross
gartered
even
with
the
swiftness
of
putting
on
jove
and
my
stars
be
praised
here
is
yet
a
postscript
reads
thou
canst
not
choose
but
know
who
i
am
if
thou
entertainest
my
love
let
it
appear
in
thy
smiling
thy
smiles

will
do
everything
that
thou
wilt
have
me
exit
fabian
i
will
not
give
my
part
of
this
sport
for
a
pension
of
thousands
to
be
paid
from
the
sophy
sir
toby
belch
i
could
marry
this
wench
for
this
device
sir
andrew
so

i
too
sir
toby
belch
and
ask
no
other
dowry
with

such
another
jest
sir

nor
i
neither
fabian
here

my
noble
gull
catcher

play
my
freedom
at

and
become
thy
bond
slave
sir
andrew

faith
or
i
either
sir
toby
belch
why
thou
hast
put
him
in
such
a
dream
that
when
the
image
of
it
leaves
him
he
must
run
mad
maria
nay
but
say
true
does
it
work
upon
him
sir
toby
belch
like
aqua
vitae
with
a
midwife
maria
if
you
will
then
see
the
fruits
of
the
sport
mark
his
first
approach
before
my
lady
he
will
come
to
her
in
yellow
stockings
and
tis
a
colour
she
abhors
and
cross
gartered
a
fashion
she
detests
and
he
will
smile
upon
her
which
will
now
be
so
unsuitable
to
her
disposition
being
addicted
to
a
melancholy
as
she
is
that
it
cannot
but
turn
him
into
a
notable
contempt
if
you
will
see
it
follow
me
sir
toby
belch
to
the
gates
of
tartar
thou

say
the

thy
tabour
if

your
reason
sir
andrew
sir
andrew
marry
i
saw
your
niece
do
more
favours
to
the
count
s
serving
man
than
ever
she
bestowed
upon
me
i
saw
t
i
the
orchard
sir
toby
belch
did
she
see
thee
the
while
old
boy
tell
me
that
sir
andrew
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
fabian
this
was
a
great
argument
of
love
in
her
toward
you
sir
andrew
slight
will
you
make
an
ass
o
me
fabian
i
will
prove
it
legitimate
sir
upon
the
oaths
of
judgment
and
reason
sir
toby
belch
and
they
have
been
grand
jury
men
since
before
noah
was
a
sailor
fabian
she
did
show
favour
to
the
youth
in
your
sight
only
to
exasperate
you
to
awake
your
dormouse
valour
to
put
fire
in
your
heart
and
brimstone
in
your
liver
you
should
then
have
accosted
her
and
with
some
excellent
jests
fire
new
from
the
mint
you
should
have
banged
the
youth
into
dumbness
this
was
looked
for
at
your
hand
and
this
was
balked
the
double
gilt
of
this
opportunity
you
let
time
wash
off
and
you
are
now
sailed
into
the
north
of
my
lady
s
opinion
where
you
will
hang
like
an
icicle
on
a
dutchman
s
beard
unless
you
do
redeem
it
by
some
laudable
attempt
either
of
valour
or
policy
sir
andrew
an
t
be
any
way
it
must
be
with
valour
for
policy
i
hate
i
had
as
lief
be
a
brownist
as
a
politician
sir
toby
belch

thy

upon
the
basis
of
valour
challenge
me

youth
to
fight
with
him
hurt
him
in
eleven
places
my
niece
shall
take
note
of
it
and
assure
thyself
there
is
no
love
broker
in
the
world
can
more
prevail
in
man
s
commendation
with
woman
than
report
of
valour
fabian
there
is
no
way
but
this
sir
andrew
sir
andrew
will
either
of
you
bear
me
a
challenge
to
him
sir
toby
belch
go
write
it
in
a
martial
hand
be
curst
and
brief
it
is
no
matter
how
witty
so
it
be
eloquent
and
fun
of
invention
taunt
him
with
the
licence
of
ink
if
thou
thou
st
him
some
thrice
it
shall
not
be
amiss
and
as
many
lies
as

lie
in
thy
sheet
of
paper
although
the
sheet
were
big
enough
for
the
bed
of
ware
in
england
set
em
down
go
about
it
let
there
be
gall
enough
in
thy
ink
though

answer

flea
i
ll
eat
the
rest
of

his
opposite

great
presage
of
cruelty
enter

very
renegado

such
impossible
passages
of
grossness
he

in
yellow
stockings
sir
toby

cross
gartered
maria
most
villanously
like
a
pedant
that
keeps
a
school
i
the
church
i
have
dogged
him
like
his
murderer
he
does
obey
every
point
of
the
letter
that
i
dropped
to
betray
him
he
does
smile
his
face
into
more
lines
than

in
the
new
map
with
the
augmentation
of
the
indies
you
have
not
seen
such
a
thing
as
tis
i
can
hardly
forbear
hurling
things
at

i
know
my

i
will
no
further
chide
you
antonio
i
could
not
stay
behind
you
my
desire
more
sharp
than
filed
steel
did
spur
me
forth
and
not
all
love
to
see
you
though
so
much
as
might
have
drawn
one
to
a
longer
voyage
but
jealousy
what
might
befall
your
travel
being
skilless
in
these
parts
which
to
a
stranger
unguided
and
unfriended
often
prove
rough
and
unhospitable
my
willing
love
the
rather
by
these
arguments
of
fear
set
forth
in
your
pursuit
sebastian
my
kind
antonio
i
can
no
other
answer
make
but
thanks
and
thanks
and
ever
[

oft
good
turns
are
shuffled
off
with
such
uncurrent
pay
but
were
my
worth
as
is
my
conscience
firm
you
should
find
better
dealing

the
things
of
fame
that

en
here

would
scarce
be
answer
d
sebastian
belike
you
slew
great
number
of
his
people
antonio
the
offence
is
not
of
such
a
bloody
nature
albeit
the
quality
of
the
time
and
quarrel
might
well
have
given
us
bloody
argument
it
might
have
since
been
answer
d
in
repaying
what
we
took
from
them
which
for
traffic
s
sake
most
of
our
city
did
only
myself
stood
out
for
which
if
i
be

[reads]
thou

so
soon
as
ever
thou
seest
him
draw
and
as
thou
drawest
swear
horrible
for
it
comes
to
pass
oft
that
a
terrible
oath
with
a
swaggering
accent
sharply
twanged
off
gives
manhood
more
approbation
than
ever
proof
itself
would
have
earned

be
of
good
capacity
and
breeding
his
employment
between
his
lord

my
niece
confirms
no
less
therefore
this
letter
being
so
excellently
ignorant
will
breed
no
terror
in
the
youth

will
find
it
comes
from
a
clodpole
but
sir

will
deliver
his
challenge

set
upon
aguecheek
a
notable
report
of
valour

drive
the

as
i
know
his
youth
will
aptly
receive
it
into
a
most
hideous
opinion
of
his
rage
skill
fury
and
impetuosity
this
will
so
fright
them
both
that
they
will
kill

the
look

there
he

there
i
found
this
credit
that
he
did
range
the

out
his
counsel

golden
service

be
some
error

when
i
saw

last
it
was
besmear
d
as
black
as
vulcan
in
the
smoke
of
war
a
bawbling
vessel
was
he
captain
of
for
shallow
draught
and
bulk
unprizable
with
which
such
scathful
grapple
did
he
make
with
the
most
noble
bottom
of
our
fleet
that
very
envy
and
the
tongue
of
loss
cried
fame
and
honour
on
him
what
s
the
matter
first
officer
orsino
this
is
that
antonio
that
took
the
phoenix
and
her
fraught
from
candy
and
this
is
he
that
did
the
tiger
board
when
your
young
nephew
titus
lost
his
leg
here
in
the
streets
desperate
of
shame
and
state
in
private
brabble
did
we
apprehend
him
viola
he
did
me
kindness
sir
drew
on
my
side
but
in
conclusion
put
strange
speech
upon
me
i
know
not
what
twas
but
distraction
duke
orsino
notable
pirate
thou
salt
water
thief
what
foolish
boldness
brought
thee
to
their
mercies
whom
thou
in
terms
so
bloody
and
so
dear
hast
made
thine
enemies
antonio
orsino
noble
sir

pleased
that
i
shake
off
these
names

me
antonio

yet
was
thief
or
pirate
though
i
confess
on
base
and
ground
enough
orsino
s
enemy
a
witchcraft
drew
me
hither
that
most
ingrateful
boy
there
by
your
side
from
the
rude
sea
s
enraged
and
foamy
mouth
did
i
redeem
a
wreck
past
hope
he
was
his
life
i
gave
him
and
did
thereto
add
my
love
without
retention
or
restraint
all
his
in
dedication
for
his
sake
did
i
expose
myself
pure
for
his
love
into
the
danger
of
this
adverse
town
drew
to
defend
him
when
he
was
beset
where
being
apprehended
his
false
cunning
not
meaning
to
partake
with
me
in
danger
taught
him
to
face
me
out
of
his
acquaintance
and
grew
a
twenty
years
removed
thing
while
one
would
wink
denied
me
mine
own
purse
which
i
had
recommended
to
his
use

half
an
hour
before

where
i
had
a
sister
whom
the
blind
waves

have
devour
d
of

what
kin
are
you

what
countryman
what

what
parentage
viola
of

sebastian
was
my

such
a
sebastian
was
my

you
come
to
fright
us
sebastian
a
spirit
i
am
indeed

dimension
grossly
clad
which
from
the
womb
i
did
participate
were
you
a
woman

the
rest
goes
even
i
should
my
tears
let
fall

drowned
viola
viola
my

had
a
mole
upon

had
mine
viola

day
when
viola
from
her
birth
had
number
d
thirteen
years

mortal
act

circumstance
of

do
cohere
and
jump

to
confirm
i

bring
you

said
to

a
thousand
times

all
those
sayings
will
i
overswear

those
swearings

true
in

orbed
continent

thy

have
given
me
such
clear
lights
of
favour
bade
me
come
smiling
and
cross
garter
d
to
you
to
put
on
yellow
stockings
and
to
frown
upon
sir
toby
and
the
lighter
people
and
acting
this
in
an
obedient
hope
why
have
you
suffer
d
me
to
be
imprison
d
kept
in
a
dark
house
visited
by
the
priest
and
made
the
most
notorious
geck
and
gull
that
e
er
invention
play
d
on
tell
me
why
olivia
alas
malvolio
this
is
not
my
writing
though
i
confess
much
like
the
character
but
out
of
question
tis
maria
s
hand
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
it
was
she
first
told
me
thou
wast
mad
then
camest
in
smiling
and
in
such
forms
which
here
were
presupposed
upon
thee
in
the
letter
prithee
be
content
this
practise
hath
most
shrewdly
pass
d
upon
thee
but
when
we
know
the
grounds
and
authors
of
it
thou
shalt
be
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
judge
of
thine
own
cause
fabian
good
madam
hear
me
speak
and
let
no
quarrel
nor
no
brawl
to
come
taint
the
condition
of
this
present
hour
which
i
have
wonder
d
at
in
hope
it
shall
not
most
freely
i
confess
myself
and
toby
set
this
device
against
malvolio
here
upon
some
stubborn
and
uncourteous
parts
we
had
conceived
against
him
maria
writ
the
letter
at
sir
toby
s
great
importance
in
recompense
whereof
he
hath
married
her
how
with
a
sportful
malice
it
was
follow
d
may
rather
pluck
on
laughter
than
revenge
if
that
the
injuries
be
justly
weigh
d
that
have
on
both
sides
pass
d
olivia
alas
poor
fool
how
have
they
baffled
thee
clown
why
some
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrown
upon
them
i
was
one
sir
in
this
interlude

that
s
all
one
by
the
lord

do
you

at
such
a
barren
rascal

gagged
and
thus
the
whirligig
of
time
brings
in
his
revenges
malvolio

ll
be
revenged
on
the
whole
pack
of
you

solemn
