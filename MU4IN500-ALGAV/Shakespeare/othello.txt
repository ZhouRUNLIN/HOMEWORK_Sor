of
venice
act
i
scene
i
venice
a
street
enter
roderigo
and
iago
roderigo
tush
never
tell
me
i
take
it
much
unkindly
that
thou
iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
as
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
iago
sblood
but
you
will
not
hear
me
if
ever
i
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
abhor
me
roderigo
thou
told
st
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
iago
despise
me
if
i
do
not
three
great
ones
of
the
city
in
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
off
capp
d
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
i
know
my
price
i
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
but
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
evades
them
with
a
bombast
circumstance
horribly
stuff
d
with
epithets
of
war
and
in
conclusion
nonsuits
my
mediators
for
certes
says
he
i
have
already
chose
my
officer
and
what
was
he
forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
one
michael
cassio
a
florentine
a
fellow
almost
damn
d
in
a
fair
wife
that
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
more
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
as
masterly
as
he
mere
prattle
without
practise
is
all
his
soldiership
but
he
sir
had
the
election
and
i
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
at
rhodes
at
cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
christian
and
heathen
must
be
be
lee
d
and
calm
d
by
debitor
and
creditor
this
counter
caster
he
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
and
i
god
bless
the
mark
his
moorship
s
ancient
roderigo
by
heaven
i
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
iago
why
there
s
no
remedy
tis
the
curse
of
service
preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
and
not
by
old
gradation
where
each
second
stood
heir
to
the
first
now
sir
be
judge
yourself
whether
i
in
any
just
term
am
affined
to
love
the
moor
roderigo
i
would
not
follow
him
then
iago
o
sir
content
you
i
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
we
cannot
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
cannot
be
truly
follow
d
you
shall
mark
many
a
duteous
and
knee
crooking
knave
that
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
master
s
ass
for
nought
but
provender
and
when
he
s
old
cashier
d
whip
me
such
honest
knaves
others
there
are
who
trimm
d
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
and
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lined
their
coats
do
themselves
homage
these
fellows
have
some
soul
and
such
a
one
do
i
profess
myself
for
sir
it
is
as
sure
as
you
are
roderigo
were
i
the
moor
i
would
not
be
iago
in
following
him
i
follow
but
myself
heaven
is
my
judge
not
i
for
love
and
duty
but
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
for
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
the
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
in
compliment
extern
tis
not
long
after
but
i
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
for
daws
to
peck
at
i
am
not
what
i
am
roderigo
what
a
full
fortune
does
the
thicklips
owe
if
he
can
carry
t
thus
iago
call
up
her
father
rouse
him
make
after
him
poison
his
delight
proclaim
him
in
the
streets
incense
her
kinsmen
and
though
he
in
a
fertile
climate
dwell
plague
him
with
flies
though
that
his
joy
be
joy
yet
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
on
t
as
it
may
lose
some
colour

distempering
draughts
upon
malicious
bravery

quiet
roderigo
sir
sir

and
pure
soul

to
you

zounds
sir
you
are
one
of
those

you
service
and
you
think

are
ruffians

have
your

a
barbary

brabantio
what
profane
wretch

one
sir
that

to
tell
you
your
daughter
and
the
moor

now
making
the
beast
with
two
backs
brabantio
thou
art
a
villain
iago
you
are
a
senator
brabantio
this
thou
shalt
answer
i
know
thee
roderigo
roderigo
sir
i
will
answer
any
thing
but
i
beseech
you
if
t
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
as
partly
i
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
at
this
odd
even
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
but
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
to
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
moor
if
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
we
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
but
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
we
have
your
wrong
rebuke
do
not
believe
that
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
i
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
i
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
in
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
of
here
and
every
where
straight
satisfy
yourself
if
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
for
thus
deluding
you
brabantio
strike
on
the
tinder
ho
give
me
a
taper
call
up
all
my
people
this
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
light
i
say
light
exit
above
iago
farewell
for
i
must
leave
you
it
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
to
be
produced
as
if
i
stay
i
shall
against
the
moor
for
i
do
know
the
state
however
this
may
gall
him
with
some
cheque
cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
he
s
embark
d
with
such
loud
reason
to
the
cyprus
wars
which
even
now
stand
in
act
that
for
their
souls
another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
to
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
though
i
do
hate
him
as
i
do
hell
pains
yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
i
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
which
is
indeed
but
sign
that
you
shall
surely
find
him
lead
to
the
sagittary
the
raised
search
and
there
will
i
be
with
him
so
farewell
exit
enter
below
brabantio
and
servants
with
torches
brabantio
it
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
and
what
s
to
come
of
my
despised
time
is
nought
but
bitterness
now
roderigo
where
didst
thou
see
her
o
unhappy
girl
with
the
moor
say
st
thou
who
would
be
a
father
how
didst
thou
know
twas

not
your
daughters

what

charms

which
the
property
of
youth
and
maidhood
may
be
abused

you
not
read
roderigo
of
some
such
thing
roderigo

one
way

another

moor

i
think
i
can
discover

get
good
guard
and

othello
iago
and
attendants
with
torches
iago
though
in
the
trade
of
war
i
have
slain
men
yet
do
i
hold
it
very
stuff
o
the
conscience
to
do
no
contrived
murder
i
lack
iniquity
sometimes
to
do
me
service
nine
or
ten
times
i
had
thought
to
have
yerk
d
him
here
under
the
ribs
othello
tis
better
as
it
is
iago
nay
but
he
prated
and
spoke
such
scurvy
and
provoking
terms
against
your
honour
that
with
the
little
godliness
i
have
i
did
full
hard
forbear
him
but
i
pray
you
sir
are
you
fast
married
be
assured
of
this
that
the
magnifico
is
much
beloved
and
hath
in
his
effect
a
voice
potential
as
double
as
the
duke

he
will
divorce
you
or
put
upon
you
what
restraint
and
grievance
the
law
with
all
his
might
to
enforce
it
on
will
give
him
cable
othello
let
him
do
his
spite
my
services
which
i
have
done
the
signiory
shall
out
tongue
his
complaints
tis
yet
to
know
which
when
i
know
that
boasting
is
an
honour
i
shall
promulgate
i
fetch
my
life
and
being
from
men
of
royal
siege

my
demerits

speak
unbonneted
to
as
proud
a
fortune

for
i
ll
refer
me
to
all
things
of
sense
if
she
in
chains
of
magic
were
not
bound
whether
a
maid
so
tender
fair
and
happy
so
opposite
to
marriage
that
she
shunned
the
wealthy
curled
darlings
of
our
nation
would
ever
have
to
incur
a
general
mock
run
from
her
guardage
to
the
sooty
bosom
of
such
a
thing
as
thou
to
fear
not
to
delight
judge
me
the
world
if
tis
not
gross
in
sense
that
thou
hast
practised
on
her
with
foul
charms
abused
her
delicate
youth
with
drugs
or
minerals
that
weaken
motion
i
ll
have
t
disputed

probable
and
palpable
to

do
attach
thee
for
an
abuser
of
the
world
a
practiser
of
arts
inhibited
and
out
of
warrant
lay
hold
upon
him
if
he
do
resist
subdue
him
at
his
peril
othello
hold
your
hands
both
you
of
my
inclining

the
rest
were
it
my
cue

till
fit
time
of

thee
to
answer

what
if
i
do
obey
how
may
the
duke
be
therewith
satisfied
whose
messengers
are
here
about
my
side
upon
some
present
business
of
the

me
to

most
worthy

him
away
mine
s
not
an
idle
cause
the
duke
himself
or
any
of
my
brothers
of
the
state
cannot
but
feel
this
wrong
as
twere
their
own
for
if
such
actions

scene
iii
a
council
chamber
the
duke
and
senators
sitting
at
a
table
officers
attending
duke
of
venice
there
is
no
composition
in
these
news
that
gives
them
credit
first
senator
indeed
they
are
disproportion
d
my
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
duke
of
venice
and
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
second
senator
and
mine
two
hundred
but
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
account
as
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
tis
oft
with
difference
yet
do
they
all
confirm
a
turkish
fleet

bearing
up
to
cyprus

of
venice
nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgment
i
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error

main
article
i
do
approve

fearful

this
cannot

by
no
assay

tis
a
pageant
to
keep
us
in
false
gaze
when
we
consider
the
importancy
of
cyprus
to
the
turk
and
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
that
as
it
more
concerns
the
turk
than
rhodes
so
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
for
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
but
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
that
rhodes
is
dress
d
in
if
we
make
thought
of
this
we
must
not
think
the
turk
is
so
unskilful
to
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
to
wake
and
wage
a

preposterously

that
in
this
foul
proceeding

thus
beguiled
your
daughter

and
you
of

the
bloody
book
of

you
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
after
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
stood
in
your
action

humbly
i
thank
your
grace
here
is
the
man
this
moor
whom
now
it
seems
your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
hath
hither
brought
duke
of
venice
senator
we
are
very
sorry
for
t
duke
of
venice
[to
othello]
what
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
brabantio
nothing
but
this
is
so
othello
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
my
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
that
i
have
ta
en
away
this
old
man
s
daughter
it
is
most
true
true
i
have
married
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
hath
this
extent
no
more
rude
am
i
in
my
speech
and
little
bless
d
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
for
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
and
little
of
this
great
world
can
i
speak
more
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
and
therefore
little
shall
i
grace
my
cause
in
speaking
for
myself
yet
by
your
gracious
patience
i
will
a
round
unvarnish
d
tale
deliver
of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
what
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
for
such
proceeding
i
am
charged
withal
i
won
his
daughter
brabantio
a
maiden
never
bold
of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
blush
d
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
of
years
of
country
credit
every
thing
to
fall
in
love
with
what
she
fear
d
to
look
on
it
is
a
judgment
maim
d
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
to
find
out
practises
of
cunning
hell
why
this
should
be
i
therefore
vouch
again
that
with
some
mixtures
powerful
o
er
the
blood
or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
he
wrought
upon
her
duke
of
venice
to
vouch
this
is
no
proof
without
more
wider
and
more
overt
test
than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
first
senator
but
othello
speak
did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
subdue
and
poison
this
young
maid
s
affections
or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
as
soul
to
soul
affordeth
othello
i
do
beseech
you
send
for
the
lady
to
the
sagittary
and
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
if
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
the
trust
the
office
i
do
hold
of
you
not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
even
fall
upon
my
life
duke
of
venice
fetch
desdemona
hither
othello
ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
exeunt
iago
and
attendants
and
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
i
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
so
justly
to
your
grave
ears
i
ll
present
how
i
did
thrive
in
this
fair
lady
s
love
and
she
in
mine
duke
of
venice
say
it
othello
othello
her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
still
question
d
me
the
story
of
my
life
from
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
that
i
have
passed
i
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
wherein
i
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
of
hair
breadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
and
portance
in
my
travels
history
wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
it
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
this
to
hear
would
desdemona
seriously
incline
but
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
she
ld
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
devour
up
my
discourse
which
i
observing
took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
to
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
intentively
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
when
i
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
that
my
youth
suffer
d
my
story
being
done
she
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
she
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
she
wish
d
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wish
d
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thank
d
me
and
bade
me
if
i
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
i
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
and
that
would
woo
her
upon
this
hint
i
spake
she
loved
me
for
the
dangers
i
had
pass
d
and
i
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
this
only
is
the
witchcraft
i
have
used
here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
enter
desdemona
iago
and
attendants
duke
of
venice
i
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
good
brabantio
take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
than
their
bare
hands
brabantio
i
pray
you
hear
her
speak
if
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
light
on
the
man
come
hither
gentle
mistress
do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
where
most
you
owe
obedience
desdemona
my
noble
father
i
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
to
you
i
am
bound
for
life
and
education
my
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
how
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
i
am
hitherto
your
daughter
but
here
s
my
husband
and
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
show
d
to
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
so
much
i
challenge
that
i
may
profess
due
to
the
moor
my
lord
brabantio
god
be
wi
you
i
have
done
please
it
your
grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
i
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
come
hither
moor
i
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
i
would
keep
from
thee
for
your
sake
jewel
i
am
glad
at
soul
i
have
no
other
child
for
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
to
hang
clogs
on
them
i
have
done
my
lord
duke
of
venice
let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
into
your
favour
when
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
by
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
to
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
what
cannot
be
preserved
when
fortune
takes
patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
the
robb
d
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
he
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
brabantio
so
let
the
turk
of
cyprus
us
beguile
we
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
he
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
but
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
but
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
that
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
these
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
but
words
are
words
i
never
yet
did
hear
that
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
i
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
duke
of
venice
the
turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
cyprus
othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
you
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
othello
the
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
my
thrice
driven
bed
of
down
i
do
agnise
a
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
i
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
these
present
wars
against
the
ottomites
most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
i
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
with
such
accommodation
and
besort
as
levels
with
her
breeding

t
at
her
father

brabantio
i

not

it
so
othello
nor

put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
by
being
in
his
eye
most
gracious
duke
to
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
and
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
to
assist

simpleness

what
would
you
desdemona

that
i
did
love
the
moor
to
live
with
him
my
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
may
trumpet
to
the
world
my
heart
s
subdued
even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
i
saw
othello
s
visage
in
his
mind
and
to
his
honour
and
his
valiant
parts
did
i
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
so
that
dear
lords
if

moth
of

the
rites
for

his
dear
absence
let
me
go
with
him
othello
let
her
have
your
voices

the
palate
of
my
appetite

to

we

whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call

to

it

it

drown
thyself
drown

i
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
i
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
i
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
put
money
in
thy

follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favour
with
an
usurped
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
cannot
be
that
desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
bitter
as

she
must
change
for

when
she
is
sated
with
his

she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
she
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
make
all
the
money
thou
canst
if
sanctimony

a
frail

and
a
supersubtle
venetian
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the

of

thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
a
pox
of
drowning
thyself
it
is
clean
out
of
the
way
seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
roderigo
wilt
thou
be
fast

my

if
i

on
the

mark
me
with
what
violence
she
first
loved
the
moor
but
for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
and
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
when
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favour
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
beauties
all
which
the
moor
is
defective
in
now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
now
sir
this
granted
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
position
who
stands
so
eminent
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
cassio
does
a
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compassing
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
why
none
why
none
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finder
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
itself
a
devilish
knave
besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
after
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
roderigo
i
cannot
believe
that
in
her
she
s
full
of
most
blessed
condition
iago
blessed
fig
s
end
the
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
if
she
had
been
blessed
she
would
never
have
loved
the
moor
blessed
pudding
didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
didst
not
mark
that
roderigo
yes
that
i
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
iago
lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
they
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
villanous
thoughts
roderigo
when
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
pish
but
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
i
have
brought
you
from
venice
watch
you
to
night
for
the
command
i
ll
lay
t
upon
you
cassio
knows
you
not
i
ll
not
be
far
from
you
do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favourably
minister
roderigo
well
iago
sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
i
cause
these
of
cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
cassio
so
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
i
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
roderigo
i
will
do
this
if
i
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
iago
i
warrant
thee
meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
i
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
farewell
roderigo
adieu
exit
iago
that
cassio
loves
her
i
do
well
believe
it
that
she
loves
him
tis
apt
and
of
great
credit
the
moor
howbeit
that
i
endure
him
not
is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
and
i
dare
think
he
ll
prove
to
desdemona
a
most
dear
husband
now
i
do
love
her
too
not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
i
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
but
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
for
that
i
do
suspect
the
lusty
moor
hath
leap
d
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
and
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
till
i
am
even
d
with
him
wife
for
wife
or
failing
so
yet
that
i
put
the
moor
at
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
that
judgment
cannot
cure
which
thing
to
do
if
this
poor
trash
of
venice
whom
i
trash
for
his
quick
hunting
stand

fear
cassio

my

make
the

thank
me
love
me

me
for

egregiously
an
ass

delicate

methinks
it
sounds
a
parley
of
provocation
cassio
an
inviting
eye

methinks
right
modest
iago
and
when

see
his
vice
tis
to
his
virtue
a
just
equinox
the
one
as
long
as
the
other
tis
pity
of
him
i
fear
the
trust
othello
puts
him
in
on
some
odd
time
of
his
infirmity
will
shake
this
island
montano
but
is

the
gravity

stillness
of
your
youth
the
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
in
mouths
of
wisest
censure
what
s
the
matter
that
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
and
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
of
a
night
brawler
give
me
answer
to
it
montano
worthy
othello
i
am
hurt
to
danger
your

me
of
all
that

do
know
nor
know
i
aught
by
me
that
s
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
unless
self
charity
be
sometimes
a
vice
and
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
when
violence
assails
us
othello
now
by

my
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to

having
my

the

my
rebuke
give
me
to

how
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
and
he
that
is
approved
in
this
offence
though
he
had
twinn
d
with
me
both
at

shall
lose
me
what
in

brimful
of

iago
who

if
partially
affined

leagued
in

thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than

thou

iago
touch
me
not
so
near
i
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
than
it
should
do
offence
to
michael
cassio
yet
i
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
thus
it
is
general
montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
help
and
cassio
following
him
with
determined
sword
to
execute
upon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steps
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
lest
by
his
clamour
as
it
so
fell
out
the
town
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foot
outran
my
purpose
and
i
return
d
the
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
to
night
i
ne
er
might
say
before
when
i
came
back
for
this
was
brief
i
found
them
close
together
at
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
when
you
yourself
did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
cannot
i
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
believe
received
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
which
patience
could
not
pass
othello
i
know
iago
thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
making
it
light
to
cassio
cassio

if
my

what

past

reputation
reputation
reputation
o
i
have
lost
my
reputation
i
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
my
reputation
iago
my
reputation
iago
as
i
am
an
honest
man
i
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
sense
in
that
than
in
reputation
reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
you
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
what
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
you
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenceless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
sue
to
him
again
and
he
s
yours
cassio
i
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
one
s
own
shadow
o
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
iago
what
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
what
had
he
done
to
you
cassio
i
know
not
iago
is
t
possible
cassio
i
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
o
god
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
iago
why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
how
came
you
thus
recovered
cassio
it
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
iago
come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
as
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
i
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
cassio
i
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
i
am
a
drunkard
had
i
as
many
mouths
as
hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
to
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
o
strange
every
inordinate
cup
is
unblessed
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
iago
come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
exclaim
no
more
against
it
and
good
lieutenant

tell
you
what
you
shall
do
our
general
s
wife
is
now
the
general
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
she
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
this
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
cassio
you
advise
me
well
iago
i
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
cassio
i
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
i
will
beseech
the
virtuous
desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
i
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
cheque
me
here
iago
you
are
in
the
right
good
night
lieutenant
i
must
to
the
watch
cassio
good
night
honest
iago
exit
iago
and
what
s
he
then
that
says
i
play
the
villain
when
this
advice
is
free
i
give
and
honest
probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
to
win
the
moor
again
for
tis
most
easy
the
inclining
desdemona
to
subdue
in
any
honest
suit
she
s
framed
as
fruitful
as
the
free
elements
and
then
for
her
to
win
the
moor
were
t
to
renounce
his
baptism
all
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
his
soul
is
so
enfetter
d
to
her
love
that
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
with
his
weak
function
how
am
i
then
a
villain
to
counsel
cassio
to
this
parallel
course
directly
to
his
good
divinity
of
hell
when
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
they
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
as
i
do
now
for
whiles
this
honest
fool
plies
desdemona
to
repair
his
fortunes
and
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
moor
i
ll
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
that
she
repeals
him
for
her
body
s
lust
and
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
she
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
moor
so
will
i
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
and
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
that
shall
enmesh
them
all

now
roderigo

do
follow

that
truly
loves
you
that
errs
in
ignorance

not
in
cunning
i
have
no
judgment
in
an
honest
face
i
prithee
call
him
back
othello
went
he
hence
now
desdemona
ay
sooth
so
humbled
that
he
hath
left
part

with
me
to
suffer
with

call
him
back

not
now

prithee
name
the
time
but
let
it
not
exceed
three
days
in
faith
he
s
penitent
and
yet
his
trespass
in
our
common
reason
save
that
they
say
the
wars
must
make
examples
out
of
their
best
is
not
almost
a
fault
to
incur
a
private
cheque
when
shall
he
come
tell
me
othello
i
wonder
in
my
soul
what
you
would
ask
me
that
i
should
deny
or
stand
so
mammering
on
what
michael
cassio
that
came

wooing
with
you

will
deny

desdemona
why
this
is
not

nourishing
dishes
or

or

i
mean
to
touch
your
love
indeed
it
shall
be
full
of
poise
and
difficult
weight
and
fearful
to
be
granted
othello
i
will
deny
thee
nothing
whereon
i
do
beseech
thee

me
this
to
leave
me
but
a
little
to
myself

ll
come

as

othello
excellent
wretch

catch
my
soul
but
i
do
love
thee
and
when
i
love
thee
not
chaos
is
come
again
iago
my
noble
lord
othello
what
dost
thou
say
iago
iago
did
michael
cassio
when
you
woo
d
my
lady
know
of
your
love
othello
he
did
from
first
to
last
why
dost
thou
ask
iago
but
for
a
satisfaction
of
my
thought
no
further
harm
othello
why
of
thy
thought
iago
iago
i
did
not
think
he
had
been
acquainted
with
her
othello
o
yes
and
went
between
us
very
oft
iago
indeed
othello
indeed
ay
indeed
discern
st
thou
aught
in
that
is
he
not
honest
iago
honest
my
lord
othello
honest
ay
honest
iago
my
lord
for
aught
i
know
othello
what
dost
thou
think
iago
think
my
lord
othello
think
my
lord
by
heaven
he
echoes
me
as
if
there
were
some
monster
in
his
thought
too
hideous
to
be
shown
thou
dost
mean
something
i
heard
thee
say
even
now
thou
likedst
not
that
when
cassio
left
my
wife
what
didst
not
like
and
when
i
told
thee
he
was
of
my
counsel
in
my
whole
course
of
wooing
thou
criedst
indeed
and
didst
contract
and
purse
thy
brow
together
as
if
thou
then
hadst
shut
up
in
thy
brain
some
horrible
conceit
if
thou
dost
love
me
show
me
thy
thought
iago
my
lord
you
know
i
love
you
othello
i
think
thou
dost
and
for
i
know
thou
rt
full
of
love
and
honesty
and
weigh
st
thy
words
before
thou
givest
them
breath
therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
for
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
that
s
just
they
are
close
delations
working
from
the
heart
that
passion
cannot
rule
iago
for
michael
cassio
i
dare
be
sworn
i
think
that
he
is
honest
othello
i
think
so
too
iago
men
should
be
what
they
seem
or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
othello
certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
iago
why
then
i
think
cassio
s
an
honest
man
othello
nay
yet
there
s
more
in
this
i
prithee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
as
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
the
worst
of
words
iago
good
my
lord
pardon
me
though
i
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
i
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
utter
my
thoughts
why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
as
where
s
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
sometimes
intrude
not
who
has
a
breast
so
pure
but
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
keep
leets
and
law
days
and
in
session
sit
with
meditations
lawful
othello
thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
iago
if
thou
but
think
st
him
wrong
d
and
makest
his
ear
a
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
iago
i
do
beseech
you
though
i
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
as
i
confess
it
is
my
nature
s
plague
to
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
shapes
faults
that
are
not
that
your
wisdom
yet
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
othello
what
dost
thou
mean
iago
good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
tis
something
nothing
twas
mine
tis
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
but
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
and
makes
me
poor
indeed
othello
by
heaven
i
ll
know
thy
thoughts
iago
you
cannot
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
nor
shall
not
whilst
tis
in
my
custody
othello
ha
iago
o
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
it
is
the
green
eyed
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
that
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
but
o
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
o
er
who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
strongly
loves
othello
o
misery
iago
poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
but
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
to
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
from
jealousy
othello
why
why
is
this
think
st
thou
i
ld
make
a
lie
of
jealousy
to
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
with
fresh
suspicions
no
to
be
once
in
doubt
is
once
to
be
resolved
exchange
me
for
a
goat
when
i
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
to
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
matching
thy
inference
tis
not
to
make
me
jealous
to
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
i
draw
the
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
for
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
no
iago
i
ll
see
before
i
doubt
when
i
doubt
prove
and
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
this
away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
iago
i
am
glad
of
it
for
now
i
shall
have
reason
to
show
the
love
and
duty
that
i
bear
you
with
franker
spirit
therefore
as
i
am
bound
receive
it
from
me
i
speak
not
yet
of
proof
look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
cassio
wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
i
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
out
of
self
bounty
be
abused
look
to
t
i
know
our
country
disposition
well
in
venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
they
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
is
not
to
leave
t
undone
but
keep
t
unknown
othello
dost
thou
say
so
iago
she
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
and
when
she
seem
d
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
she
loved
them
most
othello
and
so
she
did
iago
why
go
to
then
she
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
to
seal
her
father
s
eyes
up
close
as
oak
he
thought
twas
witchcraft
but
i
am
much
to
blame
i
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
for
too
much
loving
you
othello
i
am
bound
to
thee
for
ever
iago
i
see
this
hath
a
little
dash
d
your
spirits
othello
not
a
jot
not
a
jot
iago
i
faith
i
fear
it
has
i
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
comes
from
my
love
but
i
do
see
you
re
moved
i
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
to
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
than
to
suspicion
othello
i
will
not
iago
should
you
do
so
my
lord
my
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
as
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
cassio
s
my
worthy
friend
my
lord
i
see
you
re
moved
othello
no
not
much
moved
i
do
not
think
but
desdemona
s
honest
iago
long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
othello
and
yet
how
nature
erring
from
itself
iago
ay
there
s
the
point
as
to
be
bold
with
you
not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
tends
foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
but
pardon
me
i
do
not
in
position
distinctly
speak
of
her
though
i
may
fear
her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgment
may
fall
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
and
happily
repent
othello
farewell
farewell
if
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
leave
me
iago
iago
[going]
my
lord
i
take
my
leave
othello
why
did
i
marry
this
honest
creature
doubtless
sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
iago
[returning]
my
lord
i
would
i
might
entreat
your
honour
to
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
though
it
be
fit
that
cassio
have
his
place
for
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
you
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
with
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
much
will
be
seen
in
that
in
the
mean
time
let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
fears
as
worthy
cause
i
have
to
fear
i
am
and
hold
her
free
i
do
beseech
your
honour
othello
fear
not
my
government
iago
i
once
more
take
my
leave
exit
othello
this
fellow
s
of
exceeding
honesty
and
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
of
human
dealings
if
i
do
prove
her
haggard
though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
i
ld
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
to
pray
at
fortune
haply
for
i
am
black
and
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
that
chamberers
have
or
for
i
am
declined
into
the
vale
of
years
yet
that
s
not
much
she
s
gone
i
am
abused
and
my
relief
must
be
to
loathe
her
o
curse
of
marriage
that
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
and
not
their
appetites
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapour
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
yet
tis
the
plague
of
great
ones
prerogatived
are
they
less
than
the
base
tis
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
when
we
do
quicken
desdemona
comes
re
enter
desdemona
and
emilia
if
she
be
false
o
then
heaven
mocks
itself
i
ll
not
believe
t
desdemona
how
now
my
dear
othello
your
dinner
and
the
generous
islanders
by
you
invited
do
attend
your
presence
othello
i
am
to
blame
desdemona
why
do
you
speak
so
faintly
are
you
not
well
othello
i
have
a
pain
upon
my
forehead
here
desdemona
faith
that
s
with
watching
twill
away
again
let
me
but
bind
it
hard
within
this
hour
it
will
be
well
othello
your
napkin
is
too
little

puts
the
handkerchief
from
him
and
it
drops
let
it
alone
come
i
ll
go
in
with
you
desdemona
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
well
exeunt
othello
and
desdemona
emilia
i
am
glad
i
have
found
this
napkin
this
was
her
first
remembrance
from
the
moor
my
wayward
husband
hath
a
hundred
times
woo
d
me
to
steal
it
but
she
so
loves
the
token
for
he
conjured
her
she
should
ever
keep
it
that
she
reserves
it
evermore
about
her
to
kiss
and
talk
to
i
ll
have
the
work
ta
en
out
and
give
t
iago
what
he
will
do
with
it
heaven
knows
not
i
i
nothing
but
to
please
his
fantasy
re
enter

iago
how
now
what
do
you

emilia
do
not

a
thing

is
a
common
thing
emilia

iago
to
have
a
foolish
wife
emilia
o
is
that
all
what
will
you
give
me
now
for
the
same
handkerchief
iago
what
handkerchief
emilia
what
handkerchief
why
that
the
moor
first
gave
to
desdemona
that
which
so
often
you
did
bid
me
steal
iago
hast
stol
n
it
from
her
emilia
no

trifles
light
as

to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
the
moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
but
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
i
did
say
so
look
where
he
comes
re
enter
othello
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall

thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack
i
swear
tis
better
to
be
much
abused
than
but
to
know
t
a
little
iago
how
now
my
lord
othello
what
sense
had
i
of
her
stol
n
hours
of
lust

have
you
a
soul
or
sense
god
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
o
wretched
fool
that
livest
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
o
monstrous
world
take
note
take
note
o
world
to
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
i
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
i
ll
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offence
othello
nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
iago
i
should
be
wise
for
honesty
s
a
fool
and
loses
that
it
works
for
othello
by
the
world
i
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
i
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
i
ll
have
some
proof
her
name
that
was
as
fresh
as
dian
s
visage
is
now
begrimed
and
black
as
mine
own
face
if
there
be
cords
or
knives
poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
i
ll
not
endure
it
would
i
were
satisfied
iago
i
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
i
do
repent
me
that
i
put
it
to
you
you
would
be
satisfied
othello
would
nay
i
will
iago
and
may
but
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
behold
her
topp
d
othello
death
and
damnation
o
iago
it
were
a
tedious
difficulty
i
think
to
bring
them
to
that
prospect
damn
them
then
if
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
more
than
their
own
what
then
how
then
what
shall
i
say
where
s
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
as
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
as
ignorance
made
drunk
but
yet
i
say
if
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
have
t
othello
give
me
a
living
reason
she
s
disloyal
iago
i
do
not
like
the
office
but
sith
i
am
enter
d
in
this
cause
so
far
prick
d
to
t
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
i
will
go
on
i
lay
with
cassio
lately
and
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
i
could
not
sleep
there
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
that
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
one
of
this
kind
is
cassio
in
sleep
i
heard
him
say
sweet
desdemona
let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
and
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
cry
o
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
as
if
he
pluck
d
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
over
my
thigh
and
sigh
d
and
kiss
d
and
then
cried
cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
moor
othello
o
monstrous
monstrous
iago
nay
this
was
but
his
dream
othello
but
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
tis
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
iago
and
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
that
do
demonstrate
thinly
othello
i
ll
tear
her
all
to
pieces
iago
nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
she
may
be
honest
yet
tell
me
but
this
have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wife
s
hand
othello
i
gave
her
such
a
one
twas
my
first
gift
iago
i
know
not
that
but
such
a
handkerchief
i
am
sure
it
was
your
wife
s
did
i
to
day
see
cassio
wipe
his
beard
with
othello
if
it
be
that
iago
if
it
be
that
or
any
that
was
hers
it
speaks
against
her
with
the
other
proofs
othello
o
that
the
slave
had
forty
thousand
lives
one
is
too
poor
too
weak
for
my
revenge
now
do
i
see
tis
true
look
here
iago
all
my
fond
love
thus
do
i
blow
to
heaven
tis
gone
arise
black
vengeance
from
thy
hollow
cell
yield
up
o
love
thy
crown
and
hearted
throne
to
tyrannous
hate
swell
bosom
with
thy
fraught
for
tis
of
aspics
tongues
iago
yet
be
content
othello
o
blood
blood
blood
iago
patience
i
say
your
mind
perhaps
may
change
othello
never
iago
like
to
the
pontic
sea
whose
icy
current
and
compulsive
course
ne
er
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
to
the
propontic
and
the
hellespont
even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace
shall
ne
er
look
back
ne
er
ebb
to
humble
love
till
that
a
capable
and
wide
revenge
swallow
them
up
now
by
yond
marble
heaven
kneels
in
the
due
reverence
of
a
sacred
vow
i
here
engage
my
words
iago
do
not
rise
yet
kneels
witness
you
ever
burning
lights
above
you
elements
that
clip
us
round
about
witness
that
here
iago
doth
give
up
the
execution
of
his
wit
hands
heart
to
wrong
d
othello
s
service
let
him
command
and
to
obey
shall
be
in
me
remorse
what
bloody
business
ever
they
rise
othello
i
greet
thy
love
not
with
vain
thanks
but
with
acceptance
bounteous
and
will
upon
the
instant
put
thee
to
t
within
these
three
days
let
me
hear
thee
say
that
cassio
s
not
alive
iago
my
friend

done
at
your
request
but
let
her
live

damn
her
lewd
minx
o
damn

come
go
with
me
apart

i
dare
not

he
lies
any
where
desdemona
why
man
clown
he
s
a
soldier
and
for
one
to
say
a
soldier
lies
is
stabbing
desdemona
go
to
where
lodges
he
clown
to
tell
you
where
he
lodges
is
to
tell
you
where
i
lie
desdemona
can
any
thing
be
made
of
this
clown
i
know
not
where
he
lodges

and
hope
all

clown
to

this
is
within
the
compass
of
man

wit
and
therefore
i
will
attempt
the
doing
it
exit
desdemona
where
should
i
lose
that
handkerchief
emilia
emilia
i
know
not
madam
desdemona
believe
me
i
had
rather
have
lost
my
purse
full
of
crusadoes
and
but
my
noble
moor
is
true
of
mind
and
made
of
no
such
baseness
as
jealous
creatures
are
it
were
enough
to
put
him
to
ill
thinking
emilia
is
he
not
jealous
desdemona
who
he
i
think
the
sun
where
he
was
born
drew
all
such
humours
from
him
emilia
look
where
he
comes
desdemona
i
will
not
leave
him
now
till
cassio
be
call
d
to
him
enter
othello
how
is
t
with
you
my
lord
othello
well
my
good
lady
aside
o
hardness
to
dissemble
how
do
you
desdemona
desdemona
well
my
good
lord
othello
give
me
your
hand
this
hand
is
moist
my
lady
desdemona
it
yet
hath
felt
no
age
nor
known
no
sorrow
othello
this
argues
fruitfulness
and
liberal
heart
hot
hot
and
moist
this
hand
of
yours
requires
a
sequester
from
liberty
fasting
and
prayer
much
castigation
exercise
devout
for
here
s
a
young
and
sweating
devil
here
that
commonly
rebels
tis
a
good
hand
a
frank
one
desdemona
you
may
indeed
say
so
for
twas
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
othello
a
liberal
hand
the
hearts
of
old
gave
hands
but
our
new
heraldry
is
hands
not
hearts
desdemona
i
cannot
speak
of
this
come
now
your
promise
othello
what
promise
chuck
desdemona
i
have
sent
to
bid
cassio
come
speak
with
you
othello
i
have
a
salt
and
sorry
rheum
offends
me
lend
me
thy
handkerchief
desdemona
here
my
lord
othello
that
which
i
gave
you
desdemona
i
have
it
not
about
me
othello
not
desdemona
no
indeed
my
lord
othello
that
is
a
fault
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
people
she
told
her
while
she
kept
it
twould
make
her
amiable
and
subdue
my
father
entirely
to
her
love
but
if
she
lost
it
or
made
gift
of
it
my
father
s
eye
should
hold
her
loathed
and
his
spirits
should
hunt
after
new
fancies
she
dying
gave
it
me
and
bid
me
when
my
fate
would
have
me
wive
to
give
it
her
i
did
so
and
take
heed
on
t
make
it
a
darling
like
your
precious
eye
to
lose
t
or
give
t
away
were
such
perdition
as
nothing
else
could
match
desdemona
is
t
possible
othello
tis
true
there
s
magic
in
the
web
of
it
a
sibyl
that
had
number
d
in
the
world

sun
to
course
two
hundred
compasses
in
her
prophetic
fury
sew
d
the
work
the
worms
were
hallow
d
that
did
breed
the
silk
and
it
was
dyed
in
mummy
which
the
skilful
conserved
of
maidens
hearts
desdemona

is
t
true
othello
most
veritable
therefore

am
most
unhappy
in
the
loss
of
it
emilia
tis
not
a
year
or
two
shows
us
a
man
they
are
all
but
stomachs
and
we
all
but
food
to
eat
us
hungerly
and
when
they
are
full
they
belch

look
you
cassio
and
my
husband
enter
cassio
and
iago
iago
there
is
no
other
way

importune
her
desdemona
how
now
good
cassio
what
s
the
news
with
you
cassio
madam
my
former
suit
i
do
beseech
you
that
by
your
virtuous
means
i
may
again
exist
and
be
a
member
of
his
love
whom
i
with
all
the
office
of
my
heart
entirely
honour
i
would
not
be
delay
d
if
my
offence
be
of
such
mortal
kind
that
nor
my
service
past
nor
present
sorrows
nor
purposed
merit
in
futurity
can
ransom
me
into
his
love
again
but
to
know
so
must
be
my
benefit
so
shall
i
clothe
me
in
a
forced
content
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
other
course
to
fortune
s
alms
desdemona
alas
thrice
gentle
cassio
my
advocation
is
not
now
in
tune
my
lord
is
not
my
lord
nor
should
i
know
him
were
he
in
favour
as
in
humour
alter
d
so
help
me
every
spirit
sanctified
as
i
have
spoken
for
you
all
my
best
and
stood
within
the
blank
of
his
displeasure
for
my
free
speech
you
must
awhile
be
patient
what
i
can
do
i
will
and
more
i
will
than
for
myself
i
dare
let
that
suffice
you
iago
is
my
lord
angry
emilia
he
went
hence
but
now
and
certainly
in
strange
unquietness
iago
can
he
be
angry
i
have
seen
the
cannon
when
it
hath
blown
his
ranks
into
the
air
and
like
the
devil
from
his
very
arm
puff
d
his
own
brother
and
can
he
be
angry
something
of
moment
then
i
will
go
meet
him
there
s
matter
in
t
indeed
if
he
be
angry
desdemona
i
prithee
do
so
exit
iago
something
sure
of
state
either
from
venice
or
some
unhatch
d
practise
made
demonstrable
here
in
cyprus
to
him
hath
puddled
his
clear
spirit
and
in
such
cases
men
s
natures
wrangle
with
inferior
things
though
great
ones
are
their
object
tis
even
so
for
let
our
finger
ache
and
it
indues
our
other
healthful
members
even
to
that
sense
of
pain
nay
we
must
think
men
are
not
gods
nor
of
them
look
for
such
observances
as
fit
the
bridal
beshrew
me
much
emilia
i
was
unhandsome
warrior
as
i
am
arraigning
his
unkindness
with
my
soul

now
i
find
i
had
suborn
d
the
witness
and
he
s
indicted
falsely
emilia
pray
heaven
it
be
state
matters
as
you
think
and
no
conception
nor
no
jealous
toy
concerning
you
desdemona
alas
the
day
i
never
gave
him
cause
emilia
but
jealous
souls
will
not
be
answer
d
so
they
are
not
ever
jealous
for
the
cause
but
jealous
for
they
are
jealous
tis

cyprus
before
the
castle
enter
othello
and
iago
iago
will
you
think
so
othello
think
so
iago
iago
what
to
kiss
in
private
othello
an
unauthorized
kiss
iago
or
to
be
naked
with
her
friend
in
bed
an
hour
or
more
not
meaning
any
harm
othello
naked
in
bed
iago
and
not
mean
harm
it
is
hypocrisy
against
the
devil
they
that
mean
virtuously
and
yet
do
so
the
devil
their
virtue
tempts
and
they
tempt
heaven
iago
so
they
do
nothing
tis
a
venial
slip
but
if
i
give
my
wife
a
handkerchief
othello
what
then
iago
why
then
tis
hers
my
lord
and
being
hers
she
may
i
think
bestow
t
on
any
man
othello
she
is
protectress
of
her
honour
too
may
she
give
that
iago
her
honour
is
an
essence
that
s
not
seen
they
have
it
very
oft
that
have
it
not
but
for
the
handkerchief
othello
by
heaven
i
would
most
gladly
have
forgot
it
thou
said
st
it
comes
o
er
my
memory
as
doth
the
raven
o
er
the
infected
house
boding
to
all
he
had
my
handkerchief
iago
ay
what
of
that
othello
that
s
not
so
good
now
iago
what
if
i
had
said
i
had
seen
him
do
you
wrong
or
heard
him
say
as
knaves
be
such
abroad
who
having
by
their
own
importunate
suit
or
voluntary
dotage
of
some
mistress
convinced
or
supplied
them
cannot
choose
but
they
must
blab
othello
hath
he
said
any
thing
iago
he
hath
my
lord
but
be
you
well
assured
no
more
than
he
ll
unswear
othello
what
hath
he
said
iago
faith
that
he
did
i
know
not
what
he
did
othello
what
what
iago
lie
othello
with
her
iago
with
her
on
her
what

fulsome
handkerchief
confessions
handkerchief
to
confess
and
be
hanged
for
his
labour
first
to
be
hanged
and
then
to
confess
i
tremble
at
it
nature
would
not
invest
herself
in
such
shadowing
passion
without
some
instruction
it
is
not
words
that
shake
me
thus

the
lethargy

he
foams
at

and
by
and
by
breaks

to
savage
madness
look

little
while

in

populous
city
and
many
a
civil
monster
othello
did
he
confess

good
sir
be
a
man

every
bearded
fellow
that

but
yoked
may

with
you
there

millions
now
alive
that
nightly
lie
in
those
unproper
beds
which
they
dare
swear
peculiar
your
case
is
better
o
tis
the
spite
of
hell
the
fiend
s
arch
mock
to
lip
a
wanton
in
a
secure
couch
and
to
suppose
her
chaste
no
let
me
know
and
knowing
what
i
am
i
know
what
she
shall
be
othello
o
thou
art
wise
tis
certain
iago
stand
you
awhile
apart
confine
yourself
but
in
a
patient
list
whilst
you
were
here
o
erwhelmed
with
your
grief
a
passion
most
unsuiting
such
a
man
cassio
came
hither
i
shifted
him
away
and
laid
good
scuse
upon
your
ecstasy
bade
him
anon
return
and
here
speak
with
me
the
which
he
promised
do
but
encave
yourself
and
mark
the
fleers
the
gibes
and
notable
scorns
that
dwell
in
every
region
of
his
face
for
i
will
make
him
tell
the
tale
anew
where
how
how
oft
how
long
ago
and
when
he
hath
and
is
again
to
cope
your
wife
i
say
but
mark
his
gesture
marry
patience
or
i
shall
say
you
are
all
in
all
in
spleen
and
nothing
of
a
man
othello
dost
thou
hear
iago
i
will
be
found
most
cunning
in
my
patience
but
dost
thou
hear
most
bloody
iago
that
s
not
amiss
but
yet
keep
time
in
all
will
you
withdraw
othello
retires

the
strumpet
s
plague
to
beguile
many
and
be
beguiled
by
one
he
when
he
hears
of
her
cannot
refrain
from
the
excess
of
laughter
here
he
comes
re
enter
cassio
as
he
shall
smile
othello

go
mad

his
unbookish
jealousy

light
behavior

in

not
the

mass
of
vanity
could
make
me
iago
i
pray
you
be
content
tis
but
his
humour
the
business
of

offence
and
he
does
chide
with
you
desdemona
if
twere
no
other
iago

but
so
i
warrant
trumpets
within
hark
how
these
instruments
summon

not
all

exeunt
desdemona

enter
roderigo
how
now
roderigo
roderigo
i
do
not
find
that
thou
dealest
justly
with
me
iago
what
in
the
contrary
roderigo
every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
i
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
i
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
i
have
foolishly
suffered
iago
will
you
hear
me
roderigo
roderigo
faith
i
have
heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances
are
no
kin
together
iago
you
charge
me
most
unjustly
roderigo
with
nought
but
truth
i
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
the
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
you
have
told
me
she
hath
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
i
find
none
iago
well
go
to
very
well
roderigo
very
well
go
to
i
cannot
go
to
man
nor
tis
not
very
well
nay
i
think
it
is
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fobbed
in
it
iago
very
well
roderigo
i
tell
you
tis
not
very
well
i
will
make
myself
known
to
desdemona
if
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
i
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
i
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
iago
you
have
said
now
roderigo
ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
i
protest
intendment
of
doing
iago
why
now
i
see
there
s
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
to
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
give
me
thy
hand
roderigo
thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
i
protest
i
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
roderigo
it
hath
not
appeared
iago
i
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgment
but
roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
i
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
i
mean
purpose
courage
and
valour
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
roderigo
well
what
is
it
is
it
within
reason
and
compass
iago
sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
venice
to
depute
cassio
in
othello

place
roderigo
is
that
true
why
then
othello

desdemona
return
again
to
venice
iago
o
no
he
goes
into
mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
cassio
roderigo
how
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
iago
why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
othello
s
place
knocking
out
his
brains
roderigo
and
that
you
would
have
me
to
do
iago
ay
if
you
dare
do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right
he

to
night
with
a
harlotry
and
thither
will
i
go
to
him
he
knows
not
yet
of
his
horrorable
fortune
if
you
will
watch
his
going
thence
which
i
will
fashion
to
fall
out
between
twelve
and
one
you
may
take
him
at
your
pleasure
i
will
be
near
to
second
your
attempt
and
he
shall
fall
between
us
come
stand
not
amazed
at
it
but
go
along
with
me
i
will
show
you
such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
it
is
now
high
suppertime
and
the
night
grows
to
waste
about
it
roderigo

i
the
world
and
having
the
world
for
your
labour
tis
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
desdemona
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
emilia
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
but
i
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
if
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
and
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
yet
have
we
some
revenge
let
husbands
know
their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
and
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
as
husbands
have
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
us
for
others
is
it
sport
i
think
it
is
and
doth
affection
breed
it
i
think
it
doth
is
t
frailty
that
thus
errs
it
is
so
too
and
have
not
we
affections
desires
for
sport
and
frailty
as
men
have
then
let
them
use
us
well
else
let
them
know
the
ills
we
do
their
ills
instruct
us
so

confess
thee
freely
of

jealous
