he
was

madam
the

very
lately
spoke

ay
you

some
stain
of

in

let
me
ask
you
a
question
man
is
enemy
to
virginity
how
may
we
barricado
it
against
him
parolles
keep
him
out
helena
but
he
assails
and
our
virginity
though
valiant
in
the
defence
yet
is
weak
unfold
to
us
some
warlike
resistance
parolles
there
is
none
man
sitting
down
before
you
will
undermine
you
and
blow
you
up
helena
bless
our
poor
virginity
from
underminers
and
blowers
up
is
there
no
military
policy
how
virgins
might
blow
up
men
parolles
virginity
being
blown
down
man
will
quicklier
be
blown
up
marry
in
blowing
him
down
again
with
the
breach
yourselves
made
you
lose
your
city
it
is
not
politic
in
the
commonwealth
of
nature
to
preserve
virginity
loss
of
virginity
is
rational
increase
and
there
was
never
virgin
got
till
virginity
was
first
lost
that
you
were
made
of
is
metal
to
make
virgins
virginity
by
being
once
lost
may
be
ten
times
found
by
being
ever
kept
it
is
ever
lost
tis
too
cold
a
companion
away
with
t
helena
i
will
stand
for
t
a
little
though
therefore
i
die
a
virgin
parolles
there
s
little
can
be
said
in
t
tis
against
the
rule
of
nature
to
speak
on
the
part
of
virginity
is
to
accuse
your
mothers
which
is
most
infallible
disobedience
he
that
hangs
himself
is
a
virgin
virginity
murders
itself
and
should
be
buried
in
highways
out
of
all
sanctified
limit
as
a
desperate
offendress
against
nature
virginity
breeds
mites
much
like
a
cheese
consumes
itself
to
the
very
paring
and
so
dies
with
feeding
his
own
stomach
besides
virginity
is
peevish
proud
idle
made
of
self
love
which
is
the
most
inhibited
sin
in
the
canon
keep
it
not
you
cannot
choose
but
loose
by
t
out
with
t
within
ten
year
it
will
make
itself
ten
which
is
a
goodly
increase
and
the
principal
itself
not
much
the
worse
away

how
might
one
do

lose
it
to
her
own

he
did
profess
well
found
king
i
knew
him
helena
the
rather
will
i
spare
my
praises
towards
him
knowing
him
is
enough
on
s
bed
of
death
many
receipts
he
gave
me
chiefly
one
which
as
the
dearest
issue
of
his
practise
and
of
his
old
experience
the
oily
darling
he
bade
me
store
up
as
a
triple
eye
safer
than
mine
own
two
more
dear
i
have
so
and
hearing
your
high

is
touch
d
with
that
malignant
cause
wherein
the
honour
of
my
dear
father
s
gift
stands
chief
in
power
i
come
to
tender
it
and
my
appliance
with
all
bound
humbleness
king
we
thank
you
maiden
but
may
not
be
so
credulous
of
cure
when
our
most
learned
doctors
leave
us
and
the
congregated
college
have
concluded
that
labouring
art
can
never
ransom
nature
from
her
inaidible
estate
i
say
we
must
not
so
stain
our
judgment
or
corrupt
our
hope
to
prostitute
our
past
cure
malady
to
empirics
or
to
dissever
so
our
great
self
and
our
credit
to
esteem
a
senseless
help
when
help
past
sense
we
deem
helena
my
duty
then
shall
pay
me
for
my
pains
i
will
no
more
enforce
mine
office
on
you
humbly
entreating
from
your
royal
thoughts
a
modest
one
to
bear
me
back
again
king
i
cannot
give
thee
less
to
be
call
d
grateful
thou
thought
st
to

me
and
such
thanks
i
give
as

to
those
that
wish

what
at

i
know
thou

great
floods
have
flown
from

have
dried
when

oft
expectation
fails
and
most
oft
there
where
most

and
oft

it

ourselves

when
we
should
submit
ourselves
to
an

my

bertram
yes
my

follows

disdain
rather
corrupt
me
ever
king
tis
only

thou

st
in

the
which
i

strange
is
it
that
our

would
quite
confound

yet
stand
off

what
thou
dislikest
a

thou
dislikest
of

do
not
so
from

proceed
the

is
dignified
by
the

where
great
additions
swell

virtue
none

is
a
dropsied
honour
good
alone
is
good
without

vileness
is
so
the

she

wise
fair
in

these

not

it

good
my

the

we
shall
lose

they
say
the
french
count
has
done
most
honourable
service
widow
it
is
reported
that
he
has
taken
their
greatest
commander
and
that
with
his
own

he
slew
the

diana
take

this
french
earl
the
honour
of

diana
their

enticements
oaths
tokens
and
all
these
engines
of
lust
are
not
the

they
go
under

a
maid
hath
been
seduced
by
them
and
the
misery
is
example
that
so
terrible
shows
in
the
wreck
of
maidenhood
cannot
for
all
that
dissuade
succession
but
that
they
are
limed
with
the
twigs
that
threaten
them
i
hope
i
need
not
to
advise
you
further
but
i
hope
your
own
grace
will
keep
you
where
you
are
though
there
were
no
further
danger
known

the
modesty
which
is

the
great

honesty

my

do

so
far
deceived
in

second
lord
believe
it
my
lord
in
mine
own
direct
knowledge
without
any
malice
but
to
speak
of
him
as
my
kinsman
he
s
a
most
notable
coward
an
infinite
and
endless
liar
an
hourly
promise
breaker
the
owner
of
no
one
good
quality
worthy
your

first

it
were
fit

i
would
i
knew
in
what
particular
action
to
try
him
first

none
better
than
to
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
which
you
hear
him
so
confidently
undertake
to
do
second

i
with
a
troop
of
florentines
will
suddenly
surprise
him
such
i
will
have
whom
i
am
sure
he
knows
not
from
the
enemy
we
will
bind
and
hoodwink
him
so
that
he
shall
suppose
no
other
but
that
he
is
carried
into
the
leaguer
of
the
adversaries
when
we
bring
him
to
our
own
tents
be
but
your
lordship
present
at
his
examination
if
he
do
not
for
the
promise
of
his
life
and
in
the
highest
compulsion
of
base
fear
offer
to
betray
you
and
deliver
all
the
intelligence
in
his
power
against
you
and
that
with
the
divine
forfeit
of
his
soul
upon
oath
never
trust
my
judgment
in
any
thing
first
lord
o
for
the
love
of
laughter
let
him
fetch
his
drum
he
says
he
has
a
stratagem
for
t
when
your
lordship
sees
the
bottom
of
his
success
in
t
and
to
what
metal
this
counterfeit
lump
of
ore
will
be
melted
if
you
give
him
not
john

your
inclining
cannot
be
removed
here
he
comes

second

[aside

o
for
the
love
of

hinder
not
the
honour
of
his
design
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
in
any
hand
bertram
how
now
monsieur
this
drum
sticks
sorely
in
your
disposition
first
lord
a
pox
on
t
let
it
go
tis
but
a
drum
parolles
but
a
drum
is
t
but
a
drum
a
drum
so
lost
there
was
excellent
command
to
charge
in
with
our
horse
upon
our
own
wings
and
to
rend
our
own
soldiers
first
lord
that
was
not
to
be
blamed
in
the
command
of
the
service
it
was
a
disaster
of
war
that
caesar
himself
could
not
have
prevented
if
he
had
been
there
to
command
bertram
well
we
cannot
greatly
condemn
our
success
some
dishonour
we
had
in
the
loss
of
that
drum
but
it
is
not
to
be
recovered
parolles
it
might
have
been
recovered
bertram
it
might
but
it
is
not
now
parolles
it
is
to
be
recovered
but
that
the
merit
of
service
is
seldom
attributed
to
the
true
and
exact
performer
i
would
have
that
drum
or
another
or
hic
jacet
bertram
why
if
you
have
a
stomach
to
t
monsieur
if
you
think
your
mystery
in
stratagem
can
bring
this
instrument
of
honour
again
into
his
native
quarter
be
magnanimous
in
the
enterprise
and
go
on
i
will
grace
the
attempt
for
a
worthy
exploit
if
you
speed
well
in
it
the
duke
shall
both
speak
of
it
and
extend
to
you
what
further
becomes
his
greatness
even
to
the
utmost
syllable
of
your
worthiness
parolles
by
the
hand
of
a
soldier
i
will
undertake
it
bertram
but
you
must
not
now
slumber
in
it
parolles
i
ll
about
it
this
evening
and
i
will
presently
pen
down
my
dilemmas
encourage
myself
in
my
certainty
put
myself
into
my
mortal
preparation
and
by
midnight
look
to
hear
further
from
me
bertram
may
i
be
bold
to
acquaint
his
grace
you
are
gone
about
it
parolles
i
know
not
what
the
success
will
be
my
lord
but
the
attempt
i
vow
bertram
i
know
thou
rt
valiant
and
to
the
possibility
of
thy
soldiership
will
subscribe
for
thee
farewell

many
words
exit
second
lord
no
more
than
a
fish
loves
water
is
not
this
a
strange
fellow
my
lord
that
so
confidently
seems
to
undertake
this
business
which
he
knows
is
not
to
be
done
damns
himself
to
do
and
dares
better
be
damned
than
to
do
t
first
lord
you
do
not
know
him
my
lord
as
we
do
certain
it
is
that
he
will
steal
himself
into
a
man
s
favour
and
for
a
week
escape
a
great
deal
of
discoveries
but
when
you
find
him
out
you
have
him
ever
after
bertram
why
do
you
think
he
will
make
no
deed
at
all
of
this
that
so
seriously
he
does
address
himself
unto
second
lord
none
in
the
world
but
return
with
an
invention
and
clap
upon
you
two
or
three
probable
lies
but
we
have
almost
embossed
him
you
shall
see
his
fall
to
night
for
indeed
he
is
not
for
your
lordship
s
respect
first
lord

you
some
sport
with

night

all
the
fault
i
spoke
with
her
but
once
and
found
her
wondrous
cold
but
i
sent
to
her
by
this
same
coxcomb
that
we
have
i
the
wind
tokens
and
letters
which
she
did
re
send
and
this
is
all
i

not
put
my
reputation
now
in
any
staining

wish
you

me
trust
the
count
he
is
my

and
what
to
your
sworn
counsel
i
have
spoken
is
so
from

to

and
then
you
cannot
by
the
good
aid
that

of
you
shall
borrow
err
in
bestowing

i
should
believe
you
for
you

d
me
that
which
well
approves
you
re
great
in

helena
take
this
purse
of
gold
and
let
me
buy
your
friendly
help
thus
far
which
i
will
over
pay
and
pay
again
when
i
have
found
it
the
count
he
wooes
your
daughter
lays
down
his
wanton
siege
before
her
beauty
resolved
to
carry
her
let
her
in
fine
consent
as
we
ll
direct
her
how
tis
best
to
bear
it
now
his
important
blood
will
nought
deny
that
she
ll
demand
a
ring
the
county
wears
that
downward
hath
succeeded
in
his
house
from
son
to
son
some
four
or
five
descents
since
the
first
father
wore
it
this
ring
he
holds
in
most
rich
choice
yet
in
his
idle
fire
to
buy
his
will
it
would
not
seem
too
dear
howe
er
repented
after
widow
now
i
see
the
bottom
of
your
purpose
helena
you
see
it
lawful
then
it
is
no
more
but
that
your
daughter
ere
she
seems
as
won
desires
this
ring
appoints
him
an
encounter
in
fine
delivers
me
to
fill
the
time
herself
most
chastely
absent
after
this
to
marry
her
i
ll
add
three
thousand
crowns
to
what
is
passed
already
widow
i
have
yielded
instruct
my
daughter
how
she
shall
persever
that
time
and
place
with
this
deceit
so
lawful
may
prove
coherent
every
night
he
comes
with
musics
of
all
sorts
and
songs
composed
to
her
unworthiness
it
nothing
steads
us
to
chide
him
from
our
eaves
for
he
persists
as
if
his
life
lay
on
t
helena
why
then
to
night
let
us
assay
our
plot
which
if
it
speed
is
wicked
meaning
in
a
lawful
deed
and
lawful
meaning
in
a
lawful
act
where
both
not
sin
and
yet
a
sinful
fact
but
let
s
about
it
exeunt
act
iv
scene
i
without
the
florentine
camp
enter
second
french

with
five
or
six
other
soldiers
in
ambush
second
lord
he
can
come
no
other
way
but
by
this
hedge
corner
when
you
sally
upon
him
speak
what
terrible
language
you
will
though
you
understand
it
not
yourselves
no
matter
for
we
must
not
seem
to
understand
him
unless
some
one
among
us
whom
we
must
produce
for
an
interpreter
first
soldier
good
captain
let
me
be
the
interpreter
second
lord
art
not
acquainted
with
him
knows
he
not
thy
voice
first
soldier
no
sir
i
warrant
you
second
lord
but
what
linsey
woolsey
hast
thou
to
speak
to
us
again
first
soldier
e
en
such
as
you
speak
to
me
second
lord
he
must
think
us
some
band
of
strangers
i
the
adversary
s
entertainment
now
he
hath
a
smack
of
all
neighbouring
languages
therefore
we
must
every
one
be
a
man
of
his
own
fancy
not
to
know
what
we
speak
one
to
another
so
we
seem
to
know
is
to
know
straight
our
purpose
choughs
language
gabble
enough
and
good
enough
as
for
you
interpreter
you
must
seem
very
politic
but
couch
ho
here
he
comes
to
beguile
two
hours
in
a
sleep
and
then
to
return
and
swear
the
lies
he
forges
enter
parolles
parolles
ten
o

within
these
three
hours
twill
be
time
enough
to

what
shall
i

i
have
done
it
must
be
a
very
plausive
invention
that
carries
it
they
begin
to
smoke
me
and
disgraces
have
of
late
knocked
too
often
at
my
door
i
find
my
tongue
is
too
foolhardy
but
my
heart
hath
the
fear
of
mars
before
it
and
of
his
creatures
not
daring
the
reports
of
my
tongue
second
lord
this
is
the
first

that
e
er
thine

was
guilty
of

what
the

should
move
me
to
undertake
the
recovery
of
this
drum
being
not
ignorant
of
the
impossibility
and
knowing
i
had
no
such
purpose
i
must
give
myself
some
hurts
and
say
i
got
them
in
exploit
yet
slight
ones
will
not
carry
it

will
say
came
you
off

so
little

great

i

not

you

me
that
your

was
fontibell

no
my
good
lord
diana
bertram
titled
goddess
and
worth
it
with
addition
but
fair
soul
in
your
fine
frame
hath
love
no
quality
if
quick
fire
of
youth
light
not
your
mind
you
are
no
maiden
but
a
monument
when
you
are
dead
you
should
be
such
a
one
as
you
are
now
for
you
are
cold
and
stem
and
now
you
should
be
as
your
mother
was
when
your
sweet
self
was
got
diana
she
then
was
honest
bertram
so
should
you
be
diana
no
my
mother
did
but
duty
such
my
lord
as
you
owe
to
your
wife
bertram
no
more
o
that
i
prithee
do
not
strive
against
my
vows
i
was
compell
d
to
her
but
i
love
thee
by
love
s
own
sweet
constraint
and
will
for
ever
do
thee
all
rights
of
service
diana
ay
so
you
serve
us
till
we
serve
you
but
when
you
have
our
roses
you
barely
leave
our
thorns
to
prick
ourselves
and
mock
us
with
our
bareness
bertram
how
have
i
sworn
diana
tis
not
the
many
oaths
that
makes
the
truth
but
the
plain
single
vow
that
is
vow
d
true
what
is
not
holy
that
we
swear
not
by
but
take
the
high
st
to
witness
then
pray
you
tell
me
if
i
should
swear
by
god
s
great
attributes
i
loved
you
dearly
would
you
believe
my
oaths
when
i
did
love
you
ill
this
has
no
holding
to
swear
by
him
whom
i
protest
to
love
that
i
will
work
against
him
therefore
your
oaths
are
words
and
poor
conditions
but
unseal
d
at
least
in
my
opinion
bertram
change
it
change
it
be
not
so
holy
cruel
love
is
holy
and
my
integrity
ne
er
knew
the
crafts
that
you
do
charge
men
with
stand
no
more
off
but
give
thyself
unto
my
sick
desires
who
then
recover
say
thou
art
mine
and
ever
my
love
as
it
begins
shall
so
persever

first
lord
you
have
not
given
him
his
mother
s
letter
second
lord
i
have
delivered
it
an
hour
since
there
is
something
in
t
that
stings
his
nature
for
on
the
reading
it
he
changed
almost
into
another
man
first
lord
he
has
much
worthy
blame
laid
upon
him
for
shaking
off
so
good
a
wife
and
so
sweet
a
lady
second
lord
especially
he
hath
incurred
the
everlasting
displeasure
of
the
king
who
had
even
tuned
his
bounty
to
sing
happiness
to
him
i
will
tell
you
a
thing
but
you
shall
let
it
dwell
darkly
with
you
first
lord
when
you
have
spoken
it
tis
dead
and
i
am
the
grave
of
it
second
lord
he
hath
perverted
a
young
gentlewoman
here
in
florence
of
a
most
chaste
renown
and
this
night
he
fleshes
his
will
in
the
spoil
of
her
honour
he
hath
given
her
his
monumental
ring
and
thinks
himself
made
in
the
unchaste
composition
first
lord
now
god
delay
our
rebellion
as
we
are
ourselves
what
things
are
we
second
lord
merely
our
own
traitors
and
as
in
the
common
course
of
all
treasons
we
still
see
them
reveal
themselves
till
they
attain
to
their
abhorred
ends
so
he
that
in
this
action
contrives
against
his
own
nobility
in
his
proper
stream
o
erflows
himself
first
lord
is
it
not
meant
damnable
in
us
to
be
trumpeters
of
our
unlawful
intents
we
shall
not
then
have
his
company
to
night
second
lord
not
till
after

for
he
is
dieted
to
his
hour
first
lord
that
approaches
apace
i
would
gladly
have
him
see
his
company
anatomized
that
he
might
take
a
measure
of
his
own
judgments
wherein
so
curiously
he
had
set
this
counterfeit
second
lord
we
will
not
meddle
with
him
till
he
come
for
his
presence
must
be
the
whip
of

holy
undertaking

she
sings
in

second
lord
how
is
this
justified
first

stronger

death
her
death

freely
therefore
once
more
to
this

answered
to
his
reputation
with
the
duke

to
his
valour
what
is
his
honesty
parolles
he
will
steal

an
egg

professes
not
keeping
of

he
is
stronger
than
hercules
he
will
lie
sir
with
such
volubility
that
you
would
think
truth
were
a
fool
drunkenness
is
his
best
virtue
for
he
will
be
swine
drunk
and
in
his
sleep
he
does
little
harm
save
to
his
bed
clothes
about
him
but
they
know
his
conditions
and
lay
him
in
straw
i
have
but
little
more
to
say
sir
of
his
honesty
he
has
every
thing
that
an
honest
man
should
not
have
what
an
honest

nothing
first

him
i

more
of
his
soldiership
i
know
not
except
in

he
had
the
honour
to
be
the

there
called
mile
end
to
instruct

i
