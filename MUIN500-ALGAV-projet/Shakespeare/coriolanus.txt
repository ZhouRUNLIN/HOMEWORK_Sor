word
good

first
citizen
we
are
accounted
poor
citizens
the
patricians
good
what
authority
surfeits
on
would
relieve
us
if
they
would
yield
us
but
the
superfluity
while
it
were
wholesome
we
might
guess
they
relieved
us
humanely
but
they
think
we
are
too
dear
the
leanness
that
afflicts
us
the
object
of
our
misery
is
as
an
inventory
to
particularise
their
abundance
our
sufferance
is
a
gain
to
them
let
us
revenge
this
with
our
pikes
ere
we
become
rakes
for
the
gods
know
i
speak
this
in
hunger
for

not
in
thirst

second

speak
not
maliciously
first
citizen
i
say
unto
you
what
he
hath
done
famously
he
did
it
to
that
end
though
soft
conscienced
men
can
be
content
to
say
it
was
for
his
country
he
did
it
to
please
his
mother
and
to
be
partly
proud
which
he
is
even
till
the
altitude
of
his
virtue
second
citizen
what
he
cannot
help
in
his
nature
you
account
a
vice
in
him

in
no
way
say

is
covetous
first

i
need
not
be
barren
of

this
dearth
you
may
as

against
the
roman
state

course

on
the
way
it
takes
cracking
ten
thousand
curbs
of
more
strong
link
asunder
than

you
like

first

us
to

crammed
with
grain
make
edicts
for
usury
to
support
usurers
repeal
daily
any
wholesome
act
established
against
the
rich

provide
more
piercing
statutes
daily
to
chain
up
and
restrain
the
poor
if
the
wars
eat
us
not
up
they
will
and
there

all
the

wondrous
malicious

pretty
tale
it
may
be
you

stale
t
a
little
more
first

only
like
a
gulf
it
did
remain
i
the
midst
o
the
body
idle
and
unactive
still
cupboarding
the
viand
never
bearing
like
labour
with
the
rest
where
the
other
instruments
did
see

may
make
the

smile
as
well
as

tauntingly
replied
to
the
discontented
members
the
mutinous
parts
that
envied
his

even
so

sicinius

brutus
sicinius

ever
man

he
has
no

sicinius

brutus
mark
d
you

brutus

he
will
not

sicinius
be
mock
the
modest

brutus
the

devour
him
he
is
grown
too
proud
to

so
valiant
sicinius
such
a
nature
tickled
with
good
success
disdains
the
shadow
which
he
treads
on

i
do
wonder
his
insolence
can
brook
to
be
commanded
under
cominius
brutus
fame
at
the
which
he
aims
in
whom
already
he

will
then
cry

on
two
low

volumnia
i
pray
you
daughter
sing
or
express
yourself
in
a
more
comfortable
sort
if
my
son
were
my
husband
i
should
freelier
rejoice
in
that
absence
wherein
he
won
honour
than
in
the
embracements
of
his
bed
where
he
would
show
most
love
when
yet
he
was
but
tender
bodied
and
the
only
son
of
my
womb
when
youth
with
comeliness
plucked
all
gaze
his
way
when
for
a
day
of
kings
entreaties
a
mother
should
not
sell
him
an
hour
from
her
beholding
i
considering
how
honour
would
become
such
a
person
that
it
was
no
better
than
picture
like
to
hang
by
the
wall
if
renown
made
it
not
stir
was
pleased
to
let
him
seek
danger
where
he
was
like
to
find
fame
to
a
cruel
war
i
sent
him
from
whence
he
returned
his
brows
bound
with
oak
i
tell
thee
daughter
i
sprang
not
more
in
joy
at
first
hearing
he
was
a
man

now
in

seeing
he
had
proved
himself
a

thine

we
have
shed
together
by
the
vows
we
have

against

his
antiates

that
you
not
delay
the
present

filling
the

with
swords
advanced

we
prove
this

we

him
as
the

plebeians

he

a

indeed
that

like

menenius
he
s
a

indeed
that

you
two
are
old
men
tell
me
one
thing
that
i
shall
ask
you
both
well
sir
menenius
in
what
enormity
is
marcius
poor
in
that
you
two
have
not
in
abundance
brutus
he
s
poor
in
no
one
fault
but
stored
with
all
sicinius
especially
in
pride
brutus
and
topping
all
others
in
boasting
menenius
this
is
strange
now
do
you
two
know
how
you
are
censured
here
in
the
city
i
mean
of
us
o
the
right
hand
file
do
you
both
why
how
are
we
censured
menenius
because
you
talk
of
pride
now
will
you
not
be
angry
both
well
well
sir
well
menenius
why
tis
no
great
matter
for
a
very
little
thief
of
occasion
will
rob
you
of
a
great
deal
of
patience
give
your
dispositions
the
reins
and
be
angry
at
your
pleasures
at
the
least
if
you
take
it
as
a
pleasure
to
you
in
being
so
you
blame
marcius
for
being
proud
brutus
we
do
it
not
alone
sir
menenius
i
know
you
can
do
very
little
alone
for
your
helps
are
many
or
else
your
actions
would
grow
wondrous
single
your
abilities
are
too
infant
like
for
doing
much
alone
you
talk
of
pride
o
that
you
could
turn
your
eyes
toward
the
napes
of
your
necks
and
make
but
an
interior
survey
of
your
good
selves
o
that
you
could
brutus
what
then
sir
menenius
why
then
you
should
discover
a
brace
of
unmeriting
proud
violent
testy
magistrates
alias
fools
as
any
in
rome
sicinius
menenius
you
are
known
well
enough
too
menenius
i
am
known
to
be
a
humorous
patrician
and
one
that
loves
a
cup
of
hot
wine
with
not
a
drop
of
allaying
tiber
in
t
said
to
be
something
imperfect
in
favouring
the
first
complaint
hasty
and
tinder
like
upon
too
trivial
motion
one
that
converses
more
with
the
buttock
of
the
night
than
with
the
forehead
of
the
morning
what
i
think
i
utter
and
spend
my
malice
in
my
breath
meeting
two
such
wealsmen
as
you
are
i
cannot
call
you
lycurguses
if
the
drink
you
give
me
touch
my
palate
adversely
i
make
a
crooked
face
at
it
i
can
t
say
your
worships
have
delivered
the
matter
well
when
i
find
the
ass
in
compound
with
the
major
part
of
your
syllables
and
though
i
must
be
content
to
bear
with
those
that
say
you
are
reverend
grave
men
yet
they
lie
deadly
that
tell
you
you
have
good
faces
if
you
see
this
in
the
map
of
my
microcosm
follows
it
that
i
am
known
well
enough
too
what
barm
can
your
bisson
conspectuities
glean
out
of
this
character
if
i
be
known
well
enough
too
brutus
come
sir
come
we
know
you
well
enough
menenius
you
know
neither
me
yourselves
nor
any
thing
you
are
ambitious
for
poor
knaves
caps
and
legs
you
wear
out
a
good
wholesome
forenoon
in
hearing
a
cause
between
an
orange
wife
and
a
fosset
seller
and
then
rejourn
the
controversy
of
three
pence
to
a
second
day
of
audience
when
you
are
hearing
a
matter
between
party
and
party
if
you
chance
to
be
pinched
with
the
colic
you
make
faces
like
mummers
set
up
the
bloody
flag
against
all
patience
and
in
roaring
for
a
chamber
pot
dismiss
the
controversy
bleeding
the
more
entangled
by
your
hearing
all
the
peace
you
make
in
their
cause
is
calling
both
the
parties
knaves
you
are
a
pair
of
strange
ones
brutus
come
come
you
are
well
understood
to
be
a
perfecter
giber
for
the
table
than
a
necessary
bencher
in
the
capitol
menenius
our
very
priests
must
become
mockers
if
they
shall
encounter
such
ridiculous
subjects
as
you
are
when
you
speak
best
unto
the
purpose
it
is
not
worth
the
wagging
of
your
beards
and
your
beards
deserve
not
so
honourable
a
grave
as
to
stuff
a
botcher
s
cushion
or
to
be
entombed
in
an
ass
s
pack
saddle
yet
you
must
be
saying
marcius
is
proud
who
in
a
cheap
estimation
is
worth
predecessors
since
deucalion
though
peradventure
some
of
the
best
of
em
were
hereditary
hangmen
god
den
to
your
worships
more
of
your
conversation
would
infect
my
brain
being
the
herdsmen
of
the
beastly
plebeians
i
will
be
bold
to
take
my
leave
of
you

not
the

they
upon

malice
will
forget
with

cause
these
his

which
that
he
will
give
them
make
i
as
little
question
as
he
is
proud
to
do
t
brutus
i
heard
him
swear
were
he
to
stand
for

never
would
he
appear
i
the
market
place
nor
on
him
put
the
napless
vesture
of
humility
nor
showing
as
the
manner
is
his
wounds
to

beg
their
stinking
breaths
sicinius
tis
right
brutus
it
was
his
word
o
he
would
miss
it
rather
than
carry
it
but
by
the
suit
of
the
gentry
to
him
and
the
desire
of
the
nobles
sicinius
i
wish
no
better
than
have
him
hold
that
purpose
and
to
put
it
in
execution
brutus
tis
most
like
he
will
sicinius
it
shall
be
to
him
then
as
our
good
wills
a
sure
destruction
brutus
so
it
must
fall
out
to
him
or
our
authorities
for
an
end
we
must
suggest
the
people
in
what
hatred
he
still
hath
held
them
that
to
s
power
he
would
have
made
them
mules
silenced
their
pleaders
and
dispropertied
their
freedoms
holding
them
in
human
action
and
capacity
of
no
more
soul
nor
fitness
for
the
world
than
camels
in
the
war
who
have
their
provand
only
for
bearing
burdens
and
sore
blows
for
sinking
under
them
sicinius
this
as
you
say
suggested
at
some
time
when
his
soaring
insolence
shall
touch
the
people
which
time
shall
not
want
if
he
be
put
upon
t
and
that
s
as
easy
as
to
set
dogs
on
sheep
will
be
his
fire
to
kindle
their
dry
stubble
and
their
blaze
shall
darken
him
for
ever
enter
a
messenger
brutus
what
s
the
matter
messenger
you
are
sent
for
to
the
capitol
tis
thought
that
marcius
shall
be
consul
i
have
seen
the
dumb
men
throng
to
see
him
and
the
blind
to
bear
him
speak
matrons
flung
gloves
ladies
and
maids
their
scarfs
and
handkerchers
upon
him
as
he
pass
d
the
nobles
bended
as
to
jove
s
statue
and
the
commons
made
a
shower
and
thunder
with
their
caps
and
shouts
i
never
saw
the
like
brutus
let
s
to
the
capitol
and
carry
with
us
ears
and
eyes
for
the
time
but
hearts
for
the
event
sicinius
have
with
you
exeunt
scene
ii
the
same
the
capitol
enter
two
officers
to
lay
cushions
first
officer
come
come
they
are
almost
here
how
many
stand
for
consulships
second
officer
three
they
say
but
tis
thought
of
every
one
coriolanus
will
carry
it
first
officer
that
s
a
brave
fellow
but
he
s
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
second
officer
faith
there
had
been
many
great
men
that
have
flattered
the
people
who
ne
er
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
a
ground
therefore
for
coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
see
t
first
officer
if
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
dislikes
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
second
officer
he
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
an
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
a
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
a
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
ear
that
heard
it
first
officer
no
more
of
him

is
a

our
after

to
gratify

you

in

well
found
successes
to

little
of
that
worthy
work

by

whom
we
met
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
with
honours
like
himself
first
senator
speak
good
cominius
leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
rather
our
state

defective
for
requital
than
we
to
stretch
it
out
to
the
tribunes
masters
o
the
people
we
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
to
yield
what
passes
here
sicinius
we
are
convented
upon
a
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
the
theme
of
our
assembly
brutus
which
the
rather
we
shall
be
blest
to
do
if
he
remember
a
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
he
hath
hereto
prized
them
at
menenius

off
that
s
off
i
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
please
you
to
hear
cominius
speak
brutus
most
willingly
but
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
menenius
he
loves
your
people
but
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
worthy
cominius

i
shall

is
the

virtue
and
most
dignifies
the

if
it
be
the
man
i
speak
of
cannot
in

be
singly
counterpoised
at
sixteen
years
when
tarquin
made
a
head
for

he
fought
beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
dictator
whom
with
all
praise
i
point
at
saw
him
fight
when
with
his
amazonian

he
drove

bristled
lips

struck
him
on

in
that
day

when
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
he
proved
best

i

and
for
his
meed
was

bound
with

thus
he
waxed
like
a

and
in

of
seventeen
battles
since
he
lurch
d
all
swords
of
the
garland
for
this
last
before
and
in
corioli
let
me
say
i
cannot
speak
him
home
he
stopp
d
the
fliers
and
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
a

obey

fell
below

with
dying
cries

d
the
mortal
gate
of
the

well
be

from

mark
you
that
coriolanus
to
brag
unto

thus
i
did
and
thus
show
them
the
unaching
scars
which
i
should
hide
as
if
i
had

hire
of

only
menenius
do
not
stand
upon

we
recommend
to
you
tribunes
of
the

our
purpose
to
them
and
to
our
noble
consul
wish
we
all
joy
and
honour
senators
to
coriolanus
come
all
joy
and

flourish
of
cornets
exeunt
all
but
sicinius
and
brutus
brutus
you
see
how
he
intends
to
use
the
people
sicinius
may
they
perceive
s
intent
he
will
require
them
as
if
he
did
contemn
what
he
requested
should
be
in
them
to
give
brutus
come
we
ll
inform
them
of
our
proceedings
here
on
the
marketplace
i
know
they
do
attend
us
exeunt
scene
iii
the
same
the
forum
enter
seven
or
eight
citizens
first
citizen
once
if
he
do
require
our
voices
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
second
citizen
we
may
sir
if
we
will
third
citizen
we
have
power
in
ourselves
to
do
it
but
it
is
a
power
that
we
have
no
power
to
do
for
if
he
show
us
his
wounds
and
tell
us
his
deeds
we
are
to
put
our
tongues
into
those
wounds
and
speak
for
them
so
if
he
tell
us
his
noble
deeds
we
must
also
tell
him
our
noble
acceptance
of
them
ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
a
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
first
citizen
and
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
a
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
many
headed
multitude
third
citizen
we
have
been
called
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
auburn
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
coloured
and
truly
i
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
o
the
compass
second
citizen
think
you
so
which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
third
citizen
nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
man
s
will
tis
strongly
wedged
up
in
a
block
head
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
twould
sure
southward
second
citizen
why
that
way
third
citizen
to
lose
itself
in
a
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
a
wife
second
citizen
you
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you
may
third
citizen
are
you
all
resolved
to
give
your
voices
but
that
s
no
matter
the
greater
part
carries
it
i
say
if
he
would
incline
to
the
people
there
was
never
a
worthier
man
enter
coriolanus
in
a
gown
of
humility
with
menenius
here
he
comes
and
in
the
gown
of
humility
mark
his
behavior
we
are
not
to
stay
all
together
but
to
come
by
him
where
he
stands
by
ones
by
twos
and
by
threes
he
s
to
make
his
requests
by
particulars
wherein
every
one
of
us
has
a
single
honour
in
giving
him
our
own
voices
with
our
own
tongues
therefore
follow
me
and
i
direct
you
how
you
shall
go
by
him

of

noise
of
our

drums
menenius
o
me
the
gods

not

of
that
you
must
desire
them
to
think
upon
you

upon

like
the
virtues

and
keep

of

a
brace
re

a
third

of
my
standing
here
third
citizen
we
do
sir
tell
us
what
hath
brought
you
to
t
coriolanus
mine
own
desert
second
citizen
your
own
desert
coriolanus
ay
but
not
mine
own
desire
third
citizen
how
not
your
own
desire
coriolanus
no
sir
twas
never
my
desire
yet
to
trouble
the
poor
with
begging
third
citizen
you
must
think
if
we
give
you
any
thing
we
hope
to
gain
by
you
coriolanus
well
then
i
pray
your
price
o
the
consulship
first
citizen
the
price
is
to
ask
it
kindly
coriolanus
kindly
sir
i
pray
let
me
ha
t
i
have
wounds
to
show
you
which
shall
be
yours
in
private
your
good
voice
sir
what
say
you
second
citizen
you
shall
ha
it
worthy
sir
coriolanus
a
match
sir
there
s
in
all
two
worthy
voices
begged
i
have
your
alms
adieu
third
citizen
but
this
is
something
odd
second
citizen
an
twere
to
give
again
but
tis
no
matter
exeunt
the
three
citizens
re
enter
two
other
citizens
coriolanus
pray
you
now
if
it
may
stand
with
the
tune
of
your
voices
that
i
may
be
consul
i
have
here
the
customary
gown
fourth
citizen
you
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
coriolanus
your
enigma
fourth
citizen
you
have
been
a
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
a
rod
to
her
friends
you
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
coriolanus
you
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
i
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
i
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
a
dearer
estimation
of
them
tis
a
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
i
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
that
is
sir
i
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountiful
to
the
desirers
therefore
beseech
you
i
may
be
consul
fifth
citizen
we
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
fourth
citizen
you
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
coriolanus
i
will
not
seal
your
knowledge
with
showing
them
i
will
make
much
of
your
voices
and
so
trouble
you
no
further
both
citizens
the
gods
give
you
joy
sir
heartily
exeunt
coriolanus
most
sweet
voices
better
it
is
to
die
better
to
starve
than
crave
the
hire
which
first
we
do
deserve
why
in
this
woolvish
toge
should
i
stand
here
to
beg
of
hob
and
dick
that
do
appear
their
needless
vouches
custom

me
to
t
what
custom
wills
in
all
things

error
be
too
highly
heapt
for

he

and
by
his
looks
methink
tis
warm
at

heart
brutus
with
a
proud
heart
he
wore
his
humble
weeds
will
you
dismiss
the

re

sicinius
how
now
my
masters
have
you
chose
this
man
first
citizen
he

sir
brutus
we
pray
the

he
may

second
citizen
amen
sir
to
my
poor
unworthy
notice
he
mock
d
us
when
he
begg
d
our
voices
third
citizen
certainly
he
flouted
us
downright
first
citizen
no
tis
his
kind
of
speech
he
did
not
mock
us
second
citizen
not
one
amongst
us
save
yourself
but
says
he
used
us
scornfully
he
should
have
show
d
us
his
marks
of
merit
wounds
received
for
s
country
sicinius
why
so
he
did
i
am
sure
citizens
no
no
no
man
saw
em
third
citizen
he
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
and
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
i
would
be
consul
says
he
aged
custom
but
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
your
voices
therefore
when
we
granted
that
here
was
i
thank
you
for
your
voices
thank
you
your
most
sweet
voices
now
you
have
left
your
voices
i
have
no
further
with
you
was
not
this
mockery
sicinius
why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
see
t
or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
to
yield
your
voices
brutus
could
you
not
have
told
him
as
you
were
lesson
d
when
he
had
no
power
but
was
a
petty
servant
to
the
state
he
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
i
the
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
a
place
of
potency
and
sway
o
the
state
if
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
fast
foe
to
the
plebeii
your
voices
might
be
curses
to
yourselves
you
should
have
said
that
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
standing
your
friendly
lord
sicinius
thus
to
have
said
as
you
were
fore
advised
had
touch
d
his
spirit
and
tried
his
inclination
from
him
pluck
d
either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
as
cause
had
call
d
you
up
have
held
him
to
or
else
it
would
have
gall
d
his
surly
nature
which
easily
endures
not
article
tying
him
to
aught
so
putting
him
to
rage
you
should
have
ta
en
the
advantage
of
his
choler
and
pass
d
him
unelected
brutus
did
you
perceive
he
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
when
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
that
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
when
he
hath
power
to
crush
why
had
your
bodies
no
heart
among
you
or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
sicinius
have
you
ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
of
him
that
did
not
ask
but
mock
bestow
your
sued
for
tongues
third
citizen
he
s
not
confirm
d
we
may
deny
him
yet
second
citizen
and
will
deny
him
i
ll
have
five
hundred
voices
of
that
sound
first
citizen
i
twice
five
hundred
and
their
friends
to
piece
em
brutus
get
you
hence
instantly
and
tell
those
friends
they
have
chose
a
consul
that
will
from
them
take
their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
as
therefore
kept
to
do
so
sicinius
let
them
assemble
and
on
a
safer
judgment
all
revoke
your
ignorant
election
enforce
his
pride
and
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
with
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
how
in
his
suit
he
scorn
d
you
but
your
loves
thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
the
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
after
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
brutus
lay
a
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
laboured
no
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
cast
your
election
on
him
sicinius
say
you
chose
him
more
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
by
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
preoccupied
with
what
you
rather
must
do
than
what
you
should
made
you
against
the
grain
to
voice
him
consul
lay
the
fault
on
us
brutus
ay
spare
us
not
say
we
read
lectures
to
you
how
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
how
long
continued
and
what
stock
he
springs
of
the
noble
house
o
the
marcians
from
whence
came
that
ancus
marcius
numa
s
daughter
s
son
who
after
great
hostilius
here
was
king
of
the
same
house
publius
and
quintus
were
that
our
beat
water
brought
by
conduits
hither
and
[censorinus
]
nobly
named
so
twice
being
[by
the
people
chosen]
censor
was
his
great
ancestor
sicinius
one
thus
descended
that
hath
beside
well
in
his
person
wrought
to
be
set
high
in
place
we
did
commend
to
your
remembrances
but
you
have
found
scaling
his
present
bearing
with
his
past
that
he
s
your
fixed
enemy
and
revoke
your
sudden
approbation
brutus
say
you
ne
er
had
done
t
harp
on
that
still
but
by
our
putting
on
and
presently
when
you
have
drawn
your
number
repair
to
the
capitol
all
we
will
so
almost
all
repent
in
their
election
exeunt
citizens
brutus
let
them
go
on
this
mutiny
were
better
put
in
hazard
than
stay
past
doubt
for
greater
if
as
his
nature
is
he
fall
in
rage
with
their
refusal
both
observe
and
answer
the
vantage
of
his
anger
sicinius
to
the
capitol
come
we
will
be
there
before
the
stream
o
the
people
and
this
shall
seem
as
partly
tis
their
own
which
we
have
goaded
onward

he
came

that
which

no

coriolanus
how
no

what
his
choler
coriolanus
choler
were
i
as
patient
as
the
midnight
sleep
by

twould
be
my

sicinius
it
is
a
mind
that
shall
remain
a
poison
where
it
is
not

any
further
coriolanus

remain
hear
you
this

of

mark
you
his
absolute
shall
cominius
twas
from
the
canon
coriolanus
shall
o
good
but
most
unwise
patricians
why
you
grave
but
reckless
senators
have
you
thus
given
hydra
here
to
choose
an
officer
that
with
his
peremptory
shall
being
but
the
horn
and
noise
o
the
monster

wants
not
spirit
to
say
he
ll
turn
your
current
in
a
ditch
and
make
your

if
he

then
vail
your

if
you

d
be

fools
if

no

than
ever

it
makes

my
soul
aches
to
know
when
two
authorities
are
up
neither
supreme
how
soon
confusion
may
enter
twixt
the
gap
of
both
and
take
the
one
by

cominius
well
on
to
the
market
place
coriolanus
whoever
gave
that
counsel
to
give
forth
the
corn
o
the
storehouse
gratis
as
twas
used
sometime
in
greece
menenius
well
well
no
more
of
that
coriolanus
though
there
the
people
had
more
absolute
power
i
say
they
nourish
d
disobedience
fed
the
ruin
of
the
state
brutus
why
shall
the
people
give
one
that
speaks
thus
their
voice
coriolanus
i
ll
give
my
reasons
more
worthier
than
their
voices
they
know
the
corn
was
not
our
recompense
resting
well
assured
that
ne

did
service
for

d
to
the
war
even
when
the
navel
of
the
state
was
touch
d
they
would
not
thread
the
gates
this
kind
of
service
did
not
deserve
corn
gratis
being
i
the
war
their
mutinies
and
revolts
wherein
they
show
d
most
valour
spoke
not
for
them
the
accusation
which
they
have
often
made
against
the
senate
all
cause
unborn
could
never
be
the
motive
of
our
so
frank
donation
well
what
then
how
shall
this
bisson
multitude
digest
the
senate
s
courtesy
let
deeds
express
what
s
like
to
be
their
words
we
did
request
it
we
are
the
greater
poll
and
in
true
fear
they
gave
us
our
demands
thus
we
debase
the
nature
of
our
seats
and
make
the
rabble
call
our
cares
fears
which
will
in
time
break
ope
the
locks
o
the
senate
and
bring
in
the
crows
to
peck
the

menenius
come

brutus
enough
with
over
measure
coriolanus
no
take
more
what
may
be
sworn
by
both
divine
and
human
seal
what
i
end
withal
this
double
worship
where
one
part
does
disdain
with
cause
the
other
insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
cannot
conclude
but
by
the
yea
and
no
of
general
ignorance
it
must
omit
real
necessities
and
give

to
unstable
slightness

so
barr

nothing

therefore
beseech
you
you
that
will
be
less
fearful
than
discreet
that
love
the
fundamental
part
of

more
than
you
doubt
the
change
on

that
prefer
a
noble
life
before
a
long
and
wish
to
jump
a
body
with
a
dangerous
physic
that
s
sure
of
death
without
it
at
once
pluck
out
the
multitudinous
tongue
let
them
not
lick
the
sweet
which
is
their
poison
your
dishonour
mangles

judgment

bereaves
the

not

the
power
to

the
good
it
would
for
the

sicinius

let

puff
all
about

you
do

i
muse
my

does
not
approve
me
further
who
was
wont
to
call
them
woollen
vassals
things
created
to
buy
and
sell
with
groats
to
show
bare
heads
in
congregations
to
yawn
be
still
and
wonder
when
one
but
of
my
ordinance
stood
up
to
speak
of
peace

enter
volumnia
i
talk
of
you
why
did
you
wish

milder
would
you
have
me
false
to

rather
say
i
play

i

would
have
had
you
put
your

well

let

you
might
have
been
enough
the

you
are
with
striving

so
lesser
had
been
the
thwartings
of
your

if
you
had
not
show
d

how
ye
were
disposed
ere
they
lack
d

let

hang

ay
and
burn

enter
menenius
and
senators
menenius
come
come
you
have
been

rough
something
too
rough
you

there

no

pray
be
counsell
d
i
have
a

as

menenius
well
said

before

should
thus
stoop
to
the

but
that
the
violent
fit
o

craves
it
as
physic
for
the
whole
state
i
would
put
mine
armour
on
which
i
can
scarcely
bear
coriolanus
what
must
i
do
menenius
return
to
the
tribunes
coriolanus
well
what
then
what
then
menenius
repent
what
you
have
spoke
coriolanus
for
them
i
cannot
do
it
to
the
gods
must
i
then
do
t
to
them
volumnia
you
are
too
absolute
though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
but
when
extremities
speak
i
have
heard
you
say
honour
and
policy
like
unsever
d
friends
i
the
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
in
peace
what
each
of
them
by
the
other
lose
that
they
combine
not
there
coriolanus
tush
tush
menenius
a
good
demand
volumnia
if
it
be
honour
in
your
wars
to
seem
the
same
you
are
not
which
for
your
best
ends
you
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
that
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
with
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
it
stands
in
like
request
coriolanus
why
force
you
this
volumnia
because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
to
the
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
nor
by
the
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
but
with
such
words
that
are
but
rooted
in
your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
of
no
allowance
to
your
bosom
s
truth
now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
the
hazard
of
much
blood
i
would
dissemble
with

my

at

required
i
should
do
so
in

i
am
in

your

your

the

you
will
rather
show
our
general
louts
how
you
can
frown

spend
a
fawn
upon

for
the

of
their

menenius
noble

thus
correcting

which
thou
dost
confess
were
fit
for
thee
to

thou
wilt
frame

no
further
than
this

must
all
determine

sicinius
i
do
demand
if
you
submit
you
to
the

allow
their
officers
and
are
content
to
suffer
lawful
censure
for
such
faults
as
shall
be
proved
upon
you
coriolanus
i
am
content
menenius
lo
citizens
he
says
he
is
content
the
warlike
service
he
has
done
consider
think
upon
the
wounds
his
body
bears
which
show
like
graves
i
the
holy
churchyard
coriolanus
scratches
with
briers
scars
to
move
laughter
only
menenius
consider
further
that
when
he
speaks
not
like
a
citizen
you
find
him
like
a
soldier
do
not
take
his
rougher
accents
for
malicious
sounds
but
as
i
say
such
as
become
a
soldier
rather
than
envy
you
cominius
well
well
no
more
coriolanus
what
is
the
matter
that
being
pass
d
for
consul
with
full

i
am
so
dishonour
d
that
the
very
hour
you
take
it
off

sicinius
answer
to
us
coriolanus
say
then
tis
true
i
ought
so
sicinius
we
charge
you
that
you
have
contrived
to
take
from
rome
all
season
d
office
and
to
wind
yourself
into
a
power
tyrannical
for
which
you
are
a
traitor
to
the
people
coriolanus
how
traitor
menenius
nay
temperately
your
promise
coriolanus
the
fires
i
the
lowest
hell
fold
in
the
people
call
me
their
traitor
thou
injurious
tribune
within
thine
eyes
sat
twenty
thousand
deaths
in
thy
hand
clutch
d
as
many
millions
in
thy
lying
tongue
both
numbers
i
would
say
thou
liest
unto
thee
with
a
voice
as
free
as
i
do
pray
the
gods
sicinius
mark
you
this
people
citizens
to
the
rock
to
the
rock
with
him
sicinius
peace
we
need
not
put
new
matter
to
his
charge
what
you
have
seen
him
do
and
heard
him
speak
beating
your
officers
cursing
yourselves
opposing
laws
with
strokes
and
here
defying
those
whose
great
power
must
try
him
even
this
so
criminal
and
in
such
capital
kind
deserves
the
extremest
death
brutus
but
since
he
hath
served
well
for
rome
coriolanus
what
do
you
prate
of
service
brutus
i
talk
of
that
that
know
it
coriolanus
you
menenius
is
this
the
promise
that
you
made
your
mother
cominius
know
i
pray
you
coriolanus
i
know
no
further
let
them
pronounce
the
steep
tarpeian
death
vagabond
exile
raying
pent
to
linger
but
with
a
grain
a
day
i
would
not
buy
their
mercy
at
the
price
of
one
fair
word
nor
cheque
my
courage
for
what
they
can
give
to
have
t
with
saying
good
morrow
sicinius
for
that
he
has
as
much
as
in
him
lies
from
time
to
time
envied
against
the
people
seeking
means
to
pluck
away
their
power
as
now
at
last
given
hostile
strokes
and
that
not
in
the
presence
of
dreaded
justice
but
on
the
ministers
that
do
distribute
it
in
the
name
o
the
people
and
in
the
power
of
us
the
tribunes
we
even
from
this
instant
banish
him
our
city
in
peril
of
precipitation
from
off

stand
i
before
thee
here
then
if
thou
hast
a
heart
of
wreak
in
thee
that
wilt
revenge
thine
own
particular
wrongs
and
stop
those
maims
of
shame
seen
through
thy
country
speed
thee
straight
and
make
my
misery
serve
thy
turn
so
use
it
that
my
revengeful
services
may
prove
as
benefits
to
thee
for
i
will
fight
against
my
canker
d
country
with
the
spleen
of
all
the
under
fiends
but
if
so
be
thou
darest
not
this
and
that
to
prove
more
fortunes
thou
rt
tired
then
in
a
word
i
also
am
longer
to
live
most
weary
and
present
my
throat
to
thee
and
to
thy
ancient
malice
which
not
to
cut
would
show
thee
but
a
fool
since
i
have
ever
follow
d
thee
with
hate
drawn
tuns
of
blood
out
of
thy
country
s
breast
and
cannot
live
but
to
thy
shame
unless
it
be
to
do
thee
service
aufidius
o
marcius
marcius
each
word
thou
hast
spoke
hath
weeded
from
my
heart
a
root
of
ancient
envy
if
jupiter
should
from
yond
cloud
speak
divine
things
and
say
tis
true
i

not
believe
them
more
than
thee
all
noble
marcius
let
me
twine
mine
arms
about
that
body
where
against
my
grained
ash
an
hundred
times
hath
broke
and
scarr
d
the
moon
with
splinters
here
i
clip
the
anvil
of
my
sword
and
do
contest
as
hotly
and
as
nobly
with
thy
love
as
ever
in
ambitious
strength
i
did
contend
against
thy
valour
know
thou
first
i
loved
the
maid
i
married
never
man
sigh
d
truer
breath
but
that
i
see
thee
here
thou
noble
thing
more
dances
my
rapt
heart
than
when
i
first
my
wedded
mistress
saw
bestride
my
threshold
why
thou
mars
i
tell
thee
we
have
a
power
on
foot
and
i
had
purpose
once
more
to
hew
thy
target
from
thy
brawn
or
lose
mine
arm
fort
thou
hast
beat
me
out
twelve
several
times
and
i
have
nightly

dreamt
of

twixt

me
we
have
been
down
together
in
my
sleep
unbuckling
helms
fisting
each
other
s
throat
and
waked
half
dead
with
nothing
worthy
marcius
had
we
no
quarrel
else
to
rome
but
that
thou
art
thence
banish
d
we
would
muster
all
from
twelve
to
seventy
and
pouring
war
into
the
bowels
of
ungrateful
rome
like
a
bold
flood
o

o
come
go
in
and
take
our
friendly
senators
by
the
hands
who
now
are
here
taking
their

of
me
who
am
prepared
against
your
territories
though
not
for

coriolanus
you

therefore
most
absolute
sir
if
thou
wilt
have
the
leading
of
thine

revenges
take
the
one
half
of
my
commission
and
set
down
as
best
thou
art
experienced
since
thou
know
st
thy
country

strength
and
weakness
thine

ways
whether
to
knock
against
the
gates
of
rome
or
rudely
visit
them
in
parts
remote
to
fright
them
ere
destroy
but
come
in
let
me
commend
thee
first
to
those
that
shall
say
yea
to
thy
desires
a
thousand
welcomes
and
more
a

er
an

that
was
much
your

most
welcome
exeunt
coriolanus
and
aufidius
the
two
servingmen
come
forward
first
servingman
here
s
a
strange
alteration
second
servingman
by
my
hand
i
had
thought
to
have
strucken
him
with
a
cudgel
and
yet
my
mind
gave
me
his
clothes
made
a
false
report
of
him
first
servingman
what
an
arm
he
has
he
turned
me
about
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
as
one
would
set
up
a
top
second
servingman
nay
i
knew
by
his
face
that
there
was
something
in
him
he
had
sir
a
kind
of
face
methought
i
cannot
tell
how
to
term
it
first
servingman
he
had
so
looking
as
it
were
would
i
were
hanged
but
i
thought
there
was
more
in
him
than
i
could
think
second
servingman
so
did
i
i
ll
be
sworn
he
is
simply
the
rarest
man
i
the
world
first
servingman
i
think
he
is
but
a
greater
soldier
than
he
you
wot
on
second
servingman
who
my
master
first
servingman
nay
it
s
no
matter
for
that
second
servingman
worth
six
on
him
first
servingman
nay
not
so
neither
but
i
take
him
to
be
the
greater
soldier
second
servingman
faith
look
you
one
cannot
tell
how
to
say
that
for
the
defence
of
a
town
our
general
is
excellent
first
servingman
ay
and
for
an
assault
too
re
enter
third
servingman
third
servingman
o
slaves
i
can
tell
you
news
news
you
rascals
first
servingman
second
servingman
what
what
what
let
s
partake
third
servingman
i
would
not
be
a
roman
of
all
nations
i
had
as
lieve
be
a
condemned
man
first
servingman
second
servingman
wherefore
wherefore
third
servingman
why
here
s
he
that
was
wont
to
thwack
our
general
caius
marcius
first
servingman
why
do
you
say
thwack
our
general
third
servingman
i
do
not
say
thwack
our
general
but
he
was
always
good
enough
for
him
second
servingman
come
we
are
fellows
and
friends
he
was
ever
too
hard
for
him
i
have
heard
him
say
so
himself
first
servingman
he
was
too
hard
for
him
directly
to
say
the
troth
on
t
before
corioli
he
scotched
him
and
notched
him
like
a
carbon
ado
second
servingman
an
he
had
been
cannibally
given
he
might
have
broiled
and
eaten
him
too
first
servingman
but
more
of
thy
news
third
servingman
why
he
is
so
made
on
here
within
as
if
he
were
son
and
heir
to
mars
set
at
upper
end
o
the
table
no
question
asked
him
by
any
of
the
senators
but
they
stand
bald
before
him
our
general
himself
makes
a
mistress
of
him
sanctifies
himself
with
s
hand
and
turns
up
the
white
o
the
eye
to
his
discourse
but
the
bottom
of
the
news
is
that
our
general
is
cut
i
the
middle
and
but
one
half
of
what
he
was
yesterday
for
the
other
has
half
by
the
entreaty
and
grant
of
the
whole
table
he
ll
go
he
says
and
sowl
the
porter
of
rome
gates
by
the
ears
he
will
mow
all
down
before
him
and
leave
his
passage
polled
second
servingman
and
he
s
as
like
to
do
t
as
any
man
i
can
imagine
third
servingman
do
t
he
will
do
t
for
look
you
sir
he
has
as
many
friends
as
enemies
which
friends
sir
as
it
were
durst
not
look
you
sir
show
themselves
as
we
term
it
his
friends
whilst
he
s
in
directitude
first
servingman
directitude
what
s
that
third
servingman
but
when
they
shall
see
sir
his
crest
up
again
and
the
man
in
blood
they
will
out
of
their
burrows
like
conies
after
rain
and
revel
all
with
him
first
servingman
but
when
goes
this
forward
third
servingman
to
morrow
to
day
presently
you
shall
have
the
drum
struck
up
this
afternoon
tis
as
it
were
a
parcel
of
their
feast
and
to
be
executed
ere
they
wipe
their
lips
second
servingman
why
then
we
shall
have
a
stirring
world
again
this
peace
is
nothing
but
to
rust
iron
increase
tailors
and
breed
ballad
makers
first
servingman
let
me
have
war
say
i
it
exceeds
peace
as
far
as
day
does
night
it
s
spritely
waking
audible
and
full
of
vent
peace
is
a
very
apoplexy
lethargy
mulled
deaf
sleepy
insensible
a
getter
of
more
bastard
children
than
war
s
a
destroyer
of
men
second
servingman
tis
so
and
as
war
in
some
sort
may
be
said
to
be
a
ravisher
so
it
cannot
be
denied
but
peace
is
a
great
maker
of
cuckolds
first
servingman
ay
and
it
makes
men
hate
one
another
third

because
they
then
less

would
half

would
buy

for

sicinius
pray
let
us
go
exeunt
scene
vii
a
camp
at
a
small
distance
from
rome
enter
aufidius
and
his
lieutenant
aufidius
do
they
still
fly
to
the
roman
lieutenant
i
do
not
know
what
witchcraft
s
in
him
but
your
soldiers
use
him
as
the
grace
fore
meat
their
talk
at
table
and
their
thanks
at
end
and
you
are
darken
d
in
this
action
sir
even
by
your
own
aufidius
i
cannot
help
it
now
unless
by
using
means
i
lame
the
foot
of
our
design
he
bears
himself
more
proudlier
even
to
my
person
than
i
thought
he
would
when
first
i
did
embrace
him
yet
his
nature
in
that
s
no
changeling
and
i
must
excuse
what
cannot
be
amended
lieutenant
yet
i
wish
sir
i
mean
for
your
particular
you
had
not
join
d
in
commission
with
him
but
either
had
borne
the
action
of
yourself
or
else
to
him
had
left
it
solely
aufidius
i
understand
thee
well
and
be
thou
sure
when
he
shall
come
to
his
account
he
knows
not
what
i
can
urge
against
him
although
it
seems
and
so
he
thinks
and
is
no
less
apparent
to
the
vulgar
eye
that
he
bears
all
things
fairly
and
shows
good
husbandry
for
the
volscian
state
fights
dragon
like
and
does
achieve
as
soon
as
draw
his
sword
yet
he
hath
left
undone
that
which
shall
break
his
neck
or
hazard
mine
whene
er
we
come
to
our
account
lieutenant
sir
i
beseech
you
think
you
he
ll
carry
rome
aufidius
all
places
yield
to
him
ere
he
sits
down
and
the
nobility
of
rome
are
his
the
senators
and
patricians
love
him
too
the
tribunes
are
no
soldiers
and
their
people
will
be
as
rash
in
the
repeal
as
hasty
to
expel
him
thence
i
think
he
ll
be
to
rome
as
is
the
osprey
to
the
fish
who
takes
it
by
sovereignty
of
nature
first
he
was
a
noble
servant
to
them
but
he
could
not
carry
his
honours
even
whether
twas
pride
which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
the
happy
man
whether
defect
of
judgment
to
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
which
he
was
lord
of
or
whether
nature
not
to
be
other
than
one
thing
not
moving
from
the
casque
to
the
cushion
but
commanding
peace
even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
as
he
controll
d
the
war
but
one
of
these
as
he
hath
spices
of
them
all
not
all
for
i
dare
so
far
free
him
made
him
fear
d
so
hated
and
so
banish
d
but
he
has
a
merit
to
choke
it
in
the
utterance
so
our
virtues
lie
in
the
interpretation
of
the
time
and
power
unto
itself
most
commendable
hath
not
a
tomb
so
evident
as
a
chair
to
extol
what
it
hath
done
one
fire
drives
out
one
fire
one
nail
one
nail
rights
by
rights
falter
strengths
by
strengths
do
fail
come
let
s
away
when
caius
rome
is
thine
thou
art
poor
st
of
all
then
shortly
art
thou
mine
exeunt
act
v
scene
i
rome
a
public
place
enter
menenius
cominius
sicinius
brutus
and
others
menenius
no
i
ll
not
go
you
hear
what
he
hath
said
which
was
sometime
his
general
who
loved
him
in
a
most
dear
particular
he
call
d
me
father
but
what
o
that
go
you
that
banish
d
him
a
mile
before
his
tent
fall
down
and
knee
the
way
into
his
mercy
nay
if
he
coy
d
to
hear
cominius
speak
i
ll
keep
at
home
cominius
he
would
not
seem
to
know
me
menenius
do
you
hear
cominius
yet
one
time
he
did
call
me
by
my
name
i
urged
our
old
acquaintance
and
the
drops
that
we
have
bled
together
coriolanus
he
would
not
answer
to
forbad
all
names
he
was
a
kind
of
nothing
titleless
till
he
had
forged
himself
a
name
o
the
fire
of
burning
rome
menenius
why
so
you
have
made
good
work
a
pair
of
tribunes
that
have
rack
d
for
rome
to
make
coals
cheap
a
noble
memory
cominius
i
minded
him
how
royal
twas
to
pardon
when
it
was
less
expected
he
replied
it
was
a
bare
petition
of
a
state
to
one
whom
they
had
punish
d
menenius
very
well
could
he
say
less
cominius
i
offer
d
to
awaken
his
regard
for
s
private
friends
his
answer
to
me
was
he
could
not
stay
to
pick
them
in
a
pile
of
noisome
musty
chaff
he
said
twas
folly
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
to
leave
unburnt
and
still
to
nose
the
offence
menenius
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
i
am
one
of
those
his
mother
wife
his
child
and
this
brave
fellow
too
we
are
the
grains
you
are
the
musty
chaff
and
you
are
smelt
above
the
moon
we
must
be
burnt
for
you
sicinius
nay
pray
be
patient
if
you
refuse
your
aid
in
this
so
never
needed
help
yet
do
not
upbraid
s
with
our
distress
but
sure
if
you
would
be
your
country
s
pleader
your
good
tongue
more
than
the
instant
army
we
can
make
might
stop
our
countryman
menenius
no
i
ll
not
meddle
sicinius
pray
you
go
to
him
menenius
what
should
i
do
brutus
only
make
trial
what
your
love
can
do
for
rome
towards
marcius
menenius
well
and
say
that
marcius
return
me
as
cominius
is
return
d
unheard
what
then
but
as
a
discontented
friend
grief
shot
with
his
unkindness
say
t
be
so
sicinius
yet
your
good
will
must
have
that
thanks
from
rome
after
the
measure
as
you
intended
well
menenius
i
ll
undertake
t
i
think
he
ll
hear
me
yet
to
bite
his
lip
and
hum
at
good
cominius
much
unhearts
me
he
was
not
taken
well
he
had
not
dined
the
veins
unfill
d
our
blood
is
cold
and
then
we
pout
upon
the
morning
are
unapt
to
give
or
to
forgive
but
when
we
have
stuff
d
these
and
these
conveyances
of
our
blood
with
wine
and
feeding
we
have
suppler
souls
than
in
our
priest
like
fasts
therefore
i
ll
watch
him
till
he
be
dieted
to
my
request
and
then
i
ll
set
upon
him
brutus
you
know
the
very
road
into
his
kindness
and
cannot
lose
your
way
menenius
good
faith
i
ll
prove
him
speed
how
it
will
i
shall
ere
long
have
knowledge
of
my
success
exit
cominius
he
ll
never
hear
him
sicinius
not
cominius
i
tell
you
he
does
sit
in
gold
his
eye
red
as
twould
burn
rome
and
his
injury
the
gaoler
to
his
pity
i
kneel
d
before
him
twas
very
faintly
he
said
rise
dismiss
d
me
thus
with
his
speechless
hand
what
he
would
do
he
sent
in
writing
after
me
what
he
would
not
bound
with
an
oath
to
yield
to
his
conditions
so
that
all
hope
is
vain
unless
his
noble
mother
and
his
wife
who
as
i
hear
mean
to
solicit
him
for
mercy
to
his
country
therefore
let
s
hence
and
with
our
fair
entreaties
haste
them
on
exeunt
scene
ii
entrance
of
the
volscian
camp
before
rome
two
sentinels
on
guard
enter
to
them
menenius
first
senator
stay
whence
are
you
second
senator
stand
and
go
back
menenius
you
guard
like
men
tis
well
but
by
your
leave
i
am
an
officer
of
state
and
come
to
speak
with
coriolanus
first
senator
from
whence
menenius
from
rome
first
senator
you
may
not
pass
you
must
return
our
general
will
no
more
hear
from
thence
second
senator
you
ll
see
your
rome
embraced
with
fire
before
you
ll
speak
with
coriolanus
menenius
good
my
friends
if
you
have
heard
your
general
talk
of
rome
and
of
his
friends
there
it
is
lots
to
blanks
my
name
hath
touch
d
your
ears
it
is
menenius
first
senator
be
it
so
go
back
the
virtue
of
your
name
is
not
here
passable
menenius
i
tell
thee
fellow
the
general
is
my
lover
i
have
been
the
book
of
his
good
acts
whence
men
have
read
his
name
unparallel
d
haply
amplified
for
i
have
ever
verified
my
friends
of
whom
he
s
chief
with
all
the
size
that
verity
would
without
lapsing
suffer
nay
sometimes
like
to
a
bowl
upon
a
subtle
ground
i
have
tumbled
past
the
throw
and
in
his
praise
have
almost
stamp
d
the
leasing
therefore
fellow
i
must
have
leave
to
pass
first
senator
faith
sir
if
you
had
told
as
many
lies
in
his
behalf
as
you
have
uttered
words
in
your
own
you
should
not
pass
here
no
though
it
were
as
virtuous
to
lie
as
to
live
chastely
therefore
go
back
menenius
prithee
fellow
remember
my
name
is
menenius
always
factionary
on
the
party
of
your
general
second
senator
howsoever
you
have
been
his
liar
as
you
say
you
have
i
am
one
that
telling
true
under
him
must
say
you
cannot
pass
therefore
go
back
menenius
has
he
dined
canst
thou
tell
for
i
would
not
speak
with
him
till
after
dinner
first
senator
you
are
a
roman
are
you
menenius
i
am
as
thy
general
is
first
senator
then
you
should
hate
rome
as
he
does
can
you
when
you
have
pushed
out
your
gates
the
very
defender
of
them
and
in
a
violent
popular
ignorance
given
your
enemy
your
shield
think
to
front
his
revenges
with
the
easy
groans
of
old
women
the
virginal
palms
of
your
daughters
or
with
the
palsied
intercession
of
such
a
decayed
dotant
as
you
seem
to
be
can
you
think
to
blow
out
the
intended
fire
your
city
is
ready
to
flame
in
with
such
weak
breath
as
this
no
you
are
deceived
therefore
back
to
rome
and
prepare
for
your
execution
you
are
condemned
our
general
has
sworn
you
out
of
reprieve
and
pardon

thy
captain
knew
i
were
here

would
use
me
with
estimation

knows
you
not
menenius
i
mean
thy
general
first
senator
my
general
cares
not
for
you

half
pint
of

of
your

jack
guardant

my
entertainment
with

borne
this

this

i
have
sent
to

loved
me
above
the
measure
of
a

nay
godded
me
indeed
their
latest
refuge
was
to

i

sourly
to
him
once
more
offer
d
the

conditions
which
they
did
refuse
and
cannot
now
accept
to

him
only
that
thought

a
very
little
i

yielded
to
fresh
embassies

that
thou

remember
this
before

i
have
forsworn
to

may
never
be
held
by
you
denials
do
not
bid
me
dismiss
my
soldiers
or
capitulate
again
with

me
not
wherein
i
seem
unnatural
desire
not
to
ally
my
rages
and
revenges
with
your
colder
reasons
volumnia
o
no
more
no
more
you
have
said
you
will
not
grant
us
any
thing
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
ask
but
that
which
you
deny
already
yet
we
will
ask
that
if
you
fail
in
our
request
the
blame
may
hang
upon
your
hardness
therefore
hear
us
coriolanus
aufidius
and
you
volsces
mark
for
we
ll
hear
nought
from

in
private
your
request

we
be
silent
and
not
speak
our
raiment
and
state
of
bodies
would
bewray
what
life
we
have
led
since
thy
exile
think
with
thyself
how
more
unfortunate
than
all

are

come
hither

that
thy
sight
which
should
make
our
eyes
flow
with
joy
hearts
dance
with
comforts
constrains
them
weep
and
shake
with
fear
and
sorrow
making
the
mother
wife
and
child
to
see
the
son
the
husband
and
the
father
tearing
his
country
s
bowels
out
and
to
poor
we
thine
enmity
s
most
capital
thou
barr
st
us
our
prayers
to
the

which
is
a
comfort
that
all
but
we

for
how
can
we
alas
how
can
we
for

pray
whereto

together
with
thy

whereto

alack
or
we
must
lose
the
country
our
dear
nurse
or
else
thy
person
our
comfort
in
the
country
we
must
find
an
evident
calamity
though
we
had
our
wish
which
side
should
win
for
either
thou
must
as
a
foreign
recreant
be
led
with
manacles
thorough
our
streets
or
else
triumphantly
tread
on
thy
country
s
ruin
and
bear
the
palm
for
having
bravely
shed
thy
wife
and
children
s
blood
for
myself
son
i
purpose
not
to
wait
on
fortune
till
these
wars
determine
if
i
cannot
persuade
thee
rather
to
show
a
noble
grace
to
both
parts
than
seek
the
end
of

thou
shalt
no
sooner
march
to
assault

thou

if
it
were
so
that
our

did
tend
to
save
the
romans
thereby
to
destroy
the
volsces
whom
you
serve
you
might
condemn
us
as
poisonous
of
your

no
our
suit
is
that
you
reconcile

the
end
of

s
uncertain
but
this
certain
that
if
thou
conquer
rome
the
benefit
which
thou
shalt
thereby
reap
is
such
a
name
whose
repetition
will
be
dogg
d
with
curses
whose
chronicle
thus
writ
the
man
was
noble
but
with
his
last
attempt
he
wiped
it
out
destroy
d
his
country
and
his
name
remains
to
the
ensuing
age
abhorr
d
speak
to
me
son
thou
hast
affected
the
fine
strains
of
honour
to
imitate
the
graces
of
the
gods
to
tear
with
thunder
the
wide
cheeks
o
the

and
yet
to
charge
thy
sulphur
with
a
bolt
that
should

rive
an
oak
why

not

think
st
thou
it
honourable
for
a
noble
man
still
to
remember
wrongs
daughter
speak
you
he
cares
not
for
your
weeping

thou

perhaps
thy
childishness
will
move
him
more
than
can
our
reasons
there
s
no
man
in
the
world
more
bound
to

yet
here
he
lets
me

thou
hast
never
in
