i
turn
to
thee
and
mark
my
greeting
well
for
what
i
speak
my
body
shall
make
good
upon
this
earth
or
my
divine
soul
answer
it
in
heaven
thou
art
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
too
good
to
be
so
and
too
bad
to
live
since
the
more
fair
and
crystal
is
the
sky
the
uglier
seem
the
clouds
that
in
it
fly
once
more
the
more
to
aggravate
the
note
with
a
foul
traitor
s
name
stuff
i
thy
throat
and
wish
so
please
my
sovereign
ere
i
move
what
my
tongue
speaks
my
right
drawn
sword
may
prove
thomas
mowbray
let
not
my
cold
words
here
accuse
my
zeal
tis
not
the
trial
of
a
woman
s
war
the
bitter
clamour
of
two
eager
tongues
can
arbitrate
this
cause
betwixt
us
twain
the
blood
is
hot
that
must
be
cool
d
for
this
yet
can
i
not
of
such
tame
patience
boast
as
to
be
hush
d
and
nought
at
all
to
say
first
the
fair
reverence
of
your
highness
curbs
me
from
giving
reins
and
spurs
to
my
free
speech
which
else
would
post
until
it
had
return
d
these
terms
of
treason
doubled
down
his
throat
setting
aside
his
high
blood
s
royalty
and
let
him
be
no
kinsman
to
my
liege
i
do
defy
him
and
i
spit
at
him
call
him
a
slanderous
coward
and
a
villain
which
to
maintain
i
would
allow
him
odds
and
meet
him
were
i
tied
to
run
afoot
even
to
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
alps
or
any
other
ground
inhabitable
where
ever
englishman
durst
set
his
foot
mean
time
let
this
defend
my
loyalty
by
all
my
hopes
most
falsely
doth
he
lie
henry
bolingbroke
pale
trembling
coward
there
i
throw
my
gage
disclaiming
here
the
kindred
of
the
king
and
lay
aside
my
high
blood
s
royalty
which
fear
not
reverence
makes
thee
to
except
if
guilty
dread
have
left
thee
so
much
strength
as
to
take
up
mine
honour
s
pawn
then
stoop
by
that
and
all
the
rites
of
knighthood
else
will
i
make
good
against
thee
arm
to
arm
what
i
have
spoke
or
thou
canst
worse
devise
thomas
mowbray
i
take
it
up
and
by
that
sword
i
swear
which
gently
laid
my
knighthood
on
my
shoulder
i
ll
answer
thee
in
any
fair
degree
or
chivalrous
design
of
knightly
trial
and
when
i
mount
alive
may
i
not
light
if
i
be
traitor
or
unjustly
fight
king
richard
ii
what
doth
our
cousin
lay
to
mowbray
s
charge
it
must
be
great
that
can
inherit
us
so
much
as
of
a
thought
of
ill
in
him
henry
bolingbroke
look
what
i
speak
my
life
shall
prove
it
true
that
mowbray
hath
received
eight
thousand
nobles
in
name
of
lendings
for
your
highness
soldiers
the
which
he
hath
detain
d
for
lewd
employments
like
a
false
traitor
and
injurious
villain
besides
i
say
and
will
in
battle
prove
or
here
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
that
ever
was
survey
d
by
english
eye
that
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteen
years
complotted
and
contrived
in
this
land
fetch
from
false
mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
further
i
say
and
further
will
maintain
upon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
that
he
did
plot
the
duke
of
gloucester
s
death
suggest
his
soon
believing
adversaries
and
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
sluiced
out
his
innocent
soul
through
streams
of
blood
which
blood
like
sacrificing
abel
s
cries
even
from
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
earth
to
me
for
justice
and
rough
chastisement
and
by
the
glorious
worth
of
my
descent
this
arm
shall
do
it
or
this
life
be
spent
king
richard
ii
how
high
a
pitch
his
resolution
soars
thomas
of
norfolk
what
say
st
thou
to
this
thomas
mowbray
o
let
my
sovereign
turn
away
his
face
and
bid
his
ears
a
little
while
be
deaf
till
i
have
told
this
slander
of
his
blood
how
god
and
good
men
hate
so
foul
a
liar
king
richard
ii
mowbray
impartial
are
our
eyes
and
ears
were
he
my
brother
nay
my
kingdom
s
heir
as
he
is
but
my
father
s
brother
s
son
now
by
my
sceptre
s
awe
i
make
a
vow
such
neighbour
nearness
to
our
sacred
blood
should
nothing
privilege
him
nor
partialize
the
unstooping
firmness
of
my
upright
soul
he
is
our
subject
mowbray
so
art
thou
free
speech
and
fearless
i
to
thee
allow
thomas
mowbray
then
bolingbroke
as
low
as
to
thy
heart
through
the
false
passage
of
thy
throat
thou
liest
three
parts
of
that
receipt
i
had
for
calais
disbursed
i
duly
to
his
highness
soldiers
the
other
part
reserved
i
by
consent
for
that
my
sovereign
liege
was
in
my
debt
upon
remainder
of
a
dear
account
since
last
i
went
to
france
to
fetch
his
queen
now
swallow
down
that
lie
for
gloucester

death

but
to
my

duty
in
that
case
for
you

noble
lord

lay

grieved
soul

did
confess

with

and
green
at

door
and
the
duke
of
aumerle
at
another
king
richard

we
did
observe
cousin
aumerle
how
far
brought
you
high
hereford
on
his

duke
of

i
brought
high
hereford
if
you
call
him
so
but
to
the

and
there
i
left
him
king
richard

say
what

of
parting

were
shed
duke
of
aumerle
faith
none
for
me
except
the
north

which
then
blew

what
said
our

when
you
parted
with
him
duke

farewell
and
for
my

disdained
that
my

should
so
profane
the

that
taught
me
craft
to
counterfeit
oppression
of
such
grief
that
words
seem

buried

my
sorrow

grave
marry
would
the
word
farewell
have
lengthen
d
hours
and
added
years
to
his
short
banishment
he
should
have
had
a
volume
of
farewells
but
since
it
would
not
he
had
none
of
me
king
richard

he
is
our

cousin

tis
doubt
when

shall
call
him
home
from

whether
our
kinsman
come
to
see
his
friends
ourself
and
bushy

observed
his
courtship
to
the
common
people
how
he
did
seem
to
dive
into
their
hearts

but
they
say
the
tongues
of

men
enforce
attention
like
deep
harmony
where
words
are
scarce
they
are
seldom
spent
in
vain
for
they
breathe
truth
that
breathe
their
words
in
pain
he
that
no
more
must
say
is
listen
d
more
than
they
whom

glose

my

s

tale
may
yet
undeaf
his

no
it
is
stopp
d
with
other
flattering
sounds
as
praises
of
whose

the
wise
are
fond
lascivious
metres
to
whose
venom
sound
the
open
ear
of
youth
doth
always
listen
report
of

in
proud
italy
whose

still
our
tardy
apish
nation
limps
after

imitation

doth
the

thrust
forth
a
vanity
so
it
be
new
there
s
no
respect
how
vile
that
is
not
quickly
buzzed
into
his
ears
then
all
too
late
comes
counsel
to
be
heard
where
will
doth
mutiny
with

not
him

will
choose
tis

of

the
causes
of
our
wreck
northumberland
not
so
even
through
the
hollow
eyes
of
death
i
spy
life
peering
but
i
dare
not
say
how
near
the
tidings
of
our
comfort
is
lord
willoughby
nay
let
us
share
thy
thoughts
as
thou
dost
ours
lord
ross
be
confident
to
speak
northumberland
we
three
are
but
thyself
and
speaking
so
thy
words
are
but
as

therefore
be
bold
northumberland
then
thus
i
have
from
port
le
blanc
a
bay
in
brittany
received
intelligence
that
harry
duke
of

broke
from

sir
robert
waterton
and
francis
quoint
all
these
well
furnish
d
by
the
duke
of
bretagne
with
eight
tall
ships
three
thousand
men
of
war
are
making
hither
with
all
due
expedience
and
shortly
mean
to
touch
our
northern
shore
perhaps
they
had
ere
this
but
that
they
stay
the
first
departing
of
the
king
for
ireland
if
then
we
shall
shake
off
our
slavish
yoke
imp
out
our
drooping
country
s
broken
wing
redeem
from
broking
pawn
the
blemish
d
crown
wipe
off
the
dust
that
hides
our
sceptre
s
gilt
and
make
high
majesty
look
like
itself
away
with
me
in
post
to
ravenspurgh
but
if
you
faint
as
fearing
to
do
so
stay
and
be
secret
and
myself
will
go
lord
ross
to
horse
to
horse
urge
doubts
to
them
that
fear
lord
willoughby
hold
out
my
horse
and
i
will
first
be
there
exeunt

ii
the

queen
bushy
and
bagot
bushy
madam
your
majesty
is
too
much
sad
you
promised
when
you
parted
with
the
king
to
lay
aside
life
harming
heaviness
and
entertain
a
cheerful
disposition
queen
to
please
the
king
i
did
to
please
myself
i
cannot
do
it
yet
i
know
no
cause
why
i
should
welcome
such
a
guest
as
grief
save
bidding
farewell
to
so
sweet
a
guest
as
my
sweet
richard
yet
again
methinks
some
unborn
sorrow
ripe
in
fortune
s
womb
is
coming
towards
me
and
my
inward
soul
with
nothing
trembles
at
some
thing
it
grieves
more
than
with
parting
from
my
lord
the
king
bushy
each
substance
of
a
grief
hath
twenty
shadows
which
shows
like
grief
itself
but
is
not
so
for
sorrow
s
eye
glazed
with
blinding
tears
divides
one
thing
entire
to
many
objects
like
perspectives
which
rightly
gazed
upon
show
nothing
but
confusion
eyed
awry
distinguish
form
so
your
sweet
majesty
looking
awry
upon
your
lord
s
departure
find
shapes
of
grief
more
than
himself
to
wail
which
look
d
on
as
it
is
is
nought
but
shadows
of
what
it
is
not
then
thrice
gracious
queen
more
than
your

departure
weep
not
more

not

if
it

false
sorrow

eye
which
for

true
weeps

imaginary
queen
it
may
be
so
but
yet
my
inward
soul
persuades
me
it
is
otherwise
howe
er
it
be
i
cannot
but
be
sad
so
heavy
sad
as
though
on
thinking
on
no

i
think
makes
me
with
heavy
nothing
faint
and
shrink
bushy
tis
nothing
but
conceit
my
gracious

me
noble
lord
i
am
a
stranger
here
in
gloucestershire
these
high
wild
hills

rough
uneven
ways
draws
out
our
miles
and
makes
them
wearisome
and
yet
your
fair
discourse
hath
been
as
sugar
making
the
hard
way
sweet
and
delectable
but
i
bethink
me
what
a
weary
way
from
ravenspurgh
to
cotswold
will
be
found
in
ross
and
willoughby
wanting
your
company
which
i
protest
hath
very
much
beguiled
the
tediousness
and
process
of
my
travel
but
theirs
is
sweetened
with
the
hope
to
have
the
present
benefit
which
i
possess
and
hope
to
joy
is
little
less
in
joy
than
hope
enjoy
d
by
this
the
weary
lords
shall
make
their
way
seem
short
as
mine
hath
done
by
sight
of
what
i
have
your
noble
company
henry
bolingbroke
of
much
less
value

my
company
than
your
good
words

good

he
hath
forsook
the
court
broken
his
staff
of
office
and
dispersed
the
household
of
the
king
northumberland
what
was
his
reason
he
was
not
so
resolved
when
last
we
spake
together
henry
percy
because
your
lordship
was
proclaimed
traitor
but
he
my
lord
is
gone
to
ravenspurgh
to
offer
service
to
the
duke
of
hereford
and
sent
me
over
by
berkeley
to
discover
what
power
the

levied

the
blushing
discontented
sun
from

the
fiery
portal
of
the
east
when
he
perceives
the
envious
clouds

bent
to
dim
his
glory

to
stain
the
track
of
his
bright
passage
to

alack
alack

we
are
amazed
and
thus
long
have
we
stood
to
watch
the
fearful
bending
of
thy
knee
to
northumberland
because
we
thought
ourself
thy
lawful
king
and
if
we
be
how
dare
thy
joints
forget
to
pay
their
awful
duty
to
our
presence
if
we
be
not

us
the

dismissed
us
from

no
hand
of

bone
can
gripe
the
sacred
handle
of
our
sceptre
unless
he
do
profane
steal
or
usurp
and
though
you
think
that
all
as
you
have
done
have
torn
their
souls
by
turning
them
from
us
and
we
are
barren
and
bereft
of
friends
yet
know
my
master
god
omnipotent
is
mustering
in
his
clouds
on
our

armies
of
pestilence
and
they
shall
strike
your

ten
thousand

this
the
face

made
you
break
the
story
off
of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
london
duke
of
york
where
did
i
leave
duchess
of
york
at
that
sad
stop
my
lord
where
rude
misgovern
d
hands
from
windows
tops
threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
king
richard
s
head
duke
of
york
then
as
i
said
the
duke
great
bolingbroke
mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
which
his
aspiring
rider
seem
d
to
know
with
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
whilst
all
tongues
cried
god
save
thee
bolingbroke
you
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
so
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
with
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
jesu
preserve
thee
welcome
bolingbroke
whilst
he
from
the
one
side
to
the
other
turning
bareheaded
lower
than
his
proud
steed
s
neck
bespake
them
thus

as
in

theatre
the
eyes
of
men
after
a
well
graced
actor
leaves
the
stage
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
even
so
or
with
much
more
contempt
men
s
eyes
did
scowl
on
gentle
richard
no
man
cried
god
save
him
no
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
but
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
his
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
the
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
that
had
not
god
for
some
strong
purpose
steel
d
the
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
and
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him

hath
a
hand

son

three
months

us
tis
he
i
would
to

my

he
might
be
found
inquire
at
london
mongst
the
taverns
there
for
there
they
say
he
daily

unrestrained
loose
companions
even
such
they
say
as
stand
in
narrow
lanes
and
beat
our
watch
and
rob
our
passengers
which
he
young
wanton
and
effeminate
boy
takes
on
the
point
of
honour
to
support
so
dissolute
a
crew
henry
percy
my
lord
some
two
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
and
told
him
of
those
triumphs
held
at
oxford
henry
bolingbroke
and
what
said
the
gallant
henry
percy
his
answer
was
he
would
unto
the
stews
and
from
the
common
st
creature
pluck
a
glove
and
wear
it
as
a
favour
and
with
that
he
would
unhorse
the
lustiest
challenger
henry
bolingbroke
as
dissolute
as
desperate
yet
through
both
i
see
some
sparks
of
better
hope
which
elder
years
may
happily
bring
forth

castle
enter
king
richard
king
richard
ii
i
have
been
studying
how
i
may
compare
this
prison
where
i
live
unto
the
world
and
for
because
the
world
is
populous
and
here
is
not
a
creature
but
myself
i
cannot
do
it
yet
i
ll
hammer
it
out
my
brain
i
ll
prove
the
female
to
my
soul
my
soul
the
father
and
these
two
beget
a
generation
of
still
breeding
thoughts
and
these
same
thoughts
people
this
little
world
in
humours
like
the
people
of
this
world
for
no
thought
is
contented
the
better
sort
as
thoughts
of
things
divine
are
intermix
d
with
scruples
and
do
set
the
word
itself
against
the
word
as
thus
come
little
ones
and
then
again
it
is
as
hard
to
come
as
for
a
camel
to
thread
the
postern
of
a
small
needle
s
eye
thoughts
tending
to
ambition
they
do
plot
unlikely
wonders
how
these
vain
weak
nails
may
tear
a
passage
through
the
flinty
ribs
of
this
hard
world
my
ragged
prison
walls
and
for
they
cannot
die
in
their
own
pride
thoughts
tending
to
content
flatter
themselves
that
they
are
not
the
first
of
fortune
s
slaves
nor
shall
not
be
the
last
like
silly
beggars
who
sitting
in
the
stocks
refuge
their
shame
that
many
have
and
others
must
sit
there
and
in
this
thought
they
find
a
kind
of
ease
bearing
their
own
misfortunes
on
the
back
of
such
as
have
before
endured
the
like
thus
play
i
in
one
person
many
people
and
none
contented
sometimes
am
i
king
then
treasons
make
me
wish
myself
a
beggar
and
so
i
am
then
crushing
penury
persuades
me
i
was
better
when
a

then
am
