an
eternal
moment
or
so
i
could
be
knighted
mistress
page
what
thou
liest
sir
alice
ford
these
knights
will
hack
and
so
thou
shouldst
not
alter
the
article
of
thy
gentry
mistress
ford
we
burn
daylight
here
read
read
perceive
how
i
might
be
knighted
i
shall
think
the
worse
of
fat
men
as
long
as
i
have
an
eye
to
make
difference
of
men
s
liking
and
yet
he
would
not
swear
praised
women
s
modesty
and
gave
such
orderly
and
well
behaved
reproof
to
all
uncomeliness
that
i
would
have
sworn
his
disposition
would
have
gone
to
the
truth
of
his
words
but
they
do
no
more
adhere
and
keep
place
together
than
the
hundredth
psalm
to
the
tune
of
green
sleeves
what
tempest
i
trow
threw
this
whale
with
so
many
tuns
of
oil
in
his
belly
ashore
at
windsor
how
shall
i
be
revenged
on
him
i
think
the
best
way
were
to
entertain
him
with
hope
till
the
wicked
fire
of
lust
have
melted
him
in
his
own
grease
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
mistress
page
letter
for
letter
but
that
the
name
of

and
ford
differs
to
thy
great
comfort
in
this
mystery
of
ill
opinions
here
s
the
twin
brother
of
thy
letter
but
let
thine
inherit
first
for
i
protest
mine
never
shall

warrant
he
hath
a
thousand
of
these
letters
writ
with
blank
space
for
different
names
sure
more
and
these
are
of
the
second
edition
he
will
print
them
out
of
doubt
for
he
cares
not
what
he
puts
into
the
press
when
he
would
put
us
two
i
had
rather
be
a
giantess
and
lie
under
mount
pelion
well
i
will
find
you
twenty
lascivious
turtles
ere
one
chaste
man
mistress

why
this

the

the
very

what
doth
he
think
of
us
mistress

nay
i
know
not
it
makes
me
almost
ready
to
wrangle

mine
own
honesty
i
ll
entertain
myself
like
one
that
i
am
not
acquainted
withal
for
sure
unless
he
know
some
strain
in
me
that
i
know
not
myself
he
would
never
have
boarded
me
in
this
fury
mistress
ford

call
you
it
i
ll
be
sure
to
keep
him
above

so
will
i
if
he
come
under
my
hatches
i
ll
never
to

let

be
revenged
on
him
let
s
appoint
him
a
meeting
give
him
a
show
of
comfort
in
his
suit
and
lead
him
on
with
a
fine
baited
delay
till
he
hath
pawned
his
horses
to
mine
host
of
the
garter
mistress

nay
i
will
consent
to
act
any
villany
against
him
that
may
not
sully
the
chariness
of
our
honesty
o
that
my

saw
this
letter
it
would
give
eternal
food
to
his
jealousy
mistress

my
good

as
far
from

falstaff
very
well
sir
proceed
ford
there
is
a
gentlewoman
in
this
town
her
husband
s
name
is
ford
falstaff
well
sir
ford
i
have
long
loved
her
and
i
protest
to
you
bestowed
much
on
her
followed
her
with
a
doting
observance
engrossed
opportunities
to
meet
her
fee
d
every
slight
occasion
that
could
but
niggardly
give
me
sight
of
her
not
only
bought
many
presents
to
give
her
but
have
given
largely
to
many
to
know
what
she
would
have
given
briefly
i
have
pursued
her
as
love
hath
pursued
me
which
hath
been
on
the
wing
of
all
occasions
but
whatsoever
i
have
merited
either
in
my
mind
or
in
my
means
meed
i
am
sure
i
have
received
none
unless
experience
be
a
jewel
that
i
have
purchased
at
an
infinite
rate
and
that
hath
taught
me
to
say
this
love
like
a
shadow
flies
when
substance
love
pursues
pursuing
that
that
flies
and
flying
what
pursues
falstaff
have
you
received
no
promise
of
satisfaction
at
her
hands
ford
never
falstaff
have
you
importuned
her
to
such
a
purpose
ford
never
falstaff
of
what
quality
was
your
love
then
ford
like
a
fair
house
built
on
another
man
s
ground
so
that
i
have
lost
my
edifice
by
mistaking
the
place
where
i
erected
it
falstaff
to
what
purpose
have
you
unfolded
this
to
me
ford
when
i
have
told
you
that
i
have
told
you
all
some
say
that
though
she
appear
honest
to
me
yet
in
other
places
she
enlargeth
her
mirth
so
far
that
there
is
shrewd
construction
made
of
her
now
sir
john
here
is
the
heart
of
my
purpose
you
are
a
gentleman
of
excellent
breeding
admirable
discourse
of
great
admittance
authentic
in
your
place
and
person
generally
allowed
for
your
many
war
like
court
like
and
learned
preparations
falstaff
o
sir
ford
believe
it
for
you
know
it
there
is
money
spend
it
spend
it
spend
more
spend
all
i
have
only
give
me
so
much
of
your
time
in
exchange
of
it
as
to
lay
an
amiable
siege
to
the
honesty
of
this
ford
s
wife
use
your
art
of
wooing
win
her
to
consent
to
you
if
any
man
may
you
may
as
soon
as
any
falstaff
would
it
apply
well
to
the
vehemency
of
your
affection
that
i
should
win
what
you
would
enjoy
methinks
you
prescribe
to
yourself
very
preposterously
ford
o
understand
my
drift
she
dwells
so
securely
on
the
excellency
of
her
honour
that
the
folly
of
my
soul
dares
not
present
itself
she
is
too
bright
to
be
looked
against
now
could
i
could
come
to
her
with
any
detection
in
my
hand
my
desires
had
instance
and
argument
to
commend
themselves
i
could
drive
her
then
from
the
ward
of
her
purity
her
reputation
her
marriage
vow
and
a
thousand
other
her
defences
which
now
are
too
too
strongly
embattled

very
ill
favoredly
master
brook
ford
how
so
sir
did
she
change
her
determination
falstaff
no
master
brook
but
the
peaking
cornuto
her
husband
master
brook
dwelling
in
a
continual
larum
of
jealousy
comes
me
in
the
instant
of
our
encounter
after
we
had
embraced
kissed
protested
and
as
it
were
spoke
the
prologue
of
our
comedy
and
at
his
heels
a
rabble
of
his
companions
thither
provoked
and
instigated
by
his
distemper
and
forsooth
to
search
his
house
for
his
wife
s
love
ford
what
while
you
were
there
falstaff
while
i
was
there
ford
and
did
he
search
for
you
and
could
not
find
you
falstaff
you
shall
hear
as
good
luck
would
have
it
comes
in
one
mistress
page
gives
intelligence
of
ford
s
approach
and
in
her
invention
and
ford
s
wife
s
distraction
they
conveyed
me
into
a
buck
basket
ford
a
buck
basket
falstaff
by
the
lord
a
buck
basket
rammed
me
in
with
foul
shirts
and
smocks
socks
foul
stockings
greasy
napkins
that
master
brook
there
was
the
rankest
compound
of
villanous
smell
that
ever
offended
nostril
ford
and
how
long
lay
you
there
falstaff
nay
you
shall
hear
master
brook
what
i
have
suffered
to
bring
this
woman
to
evil
for
your
good
being
thus
crammed
in
the
basket
a
couple
of
ford
s
knaves
his
hinds
were
called
forth
by
their
mistress
to
carry
me
in
the
name
of
foul
clothes
to
datchet
lane
they
took
me
on
their
shoulders
met
the
jealous
knave
their
master
in
the
door
who
asked
them
once
or
twice
what
they
had
in
their
basket
i
quaked
for
fear
lest
the
lunatic
knave
would
have
searched
it
but
fate
ordaining
he
should
be
a
cuckold
held
his
hand
well
on
went
he
for
a
search
and
away
went
i
for
foul
clothes
but
mark
the
sequel
master
brook
i
suffered
the
pangs
of
three
several
deaths
first
an
intolerable
fright
to
be
detected
with
a
jealous
rotten
bell
wether
next
to
be
compassed
like
a
good
bilbo
in
the
circumference
of
a
peck
hilt
to
point
heel
to
head
and
then
to
be
stopped
in
like
a
strong
distillation
with
stinking
clothes
that
fretted
in
their
own
grease
think
of
that
a
man

is
an
old
tale
goes

sometime
a
keeper
here
in

forest
doth
all
the
winter
time
at
still
midnight
walk
round
about
an
oak
with
great
ragg
d
horns
and
there
he
blasts
the
tree
and
takes
the
cattle
and
makes
milch
kine
yield
blood
and
shakes
a
chain
in
a
most
hideous
and
dreadful
manner
you

heard
of
such
a
spirit

so
sacred
paths
he
dares
to

for

quaint
in
green
she
shall
be
loose
enrobed
with

pendent
flaring
bout

when
the

spies
his

ripe
to

her
by
the
hand
and
on
that
