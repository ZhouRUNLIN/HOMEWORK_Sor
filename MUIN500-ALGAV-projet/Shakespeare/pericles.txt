be
done
by
none

custom
what
they
did
begin
was
with
long
use
account
no

fellow
which
to
prevent
he
made
a
law

keep
her
still
and
men
in
awe
that
whoso
ask
d
her
for
his
wife
his
riddle
told

in

bad

abuse
your
soul

now
you
re
both
a
father

a
son
by
your
untimely
claspings
with
your
child

pleasure
fits
an

not
a
father
and
she
an
eater
of
her
mother

flesh
by
the
defiling

me
then
i
went
to
antioch
where
as
thou
know
st
against
the
face
of
death
i
sought
the
purchase
of
a
glorious
beauty
from
whence
an
issue
i
might
propagate
are
arms
to
princes
and
bring
joys
to
subjects
her
face
was
to
mine
eye
beyond
all
wonder
the
rest
hark
in
thine
ear
as
black
as
incest
which
by
my
knowledge
found
the
sinful
father
seem
d
not
to
strike
but
smooth
but
thou
know
st
this
tis
time
to
fear
when
tyrants
seem
to
kiss
such
fear
so
grew
in
me
i
hither
fled
under
the
covering
of
a
careful
night
who
seem
d
my
good
protector
and
being
here
bethought
me
what
was
past
what
might
succeed
i
knew
him
tyrannous
and
tyrants
fears
decrease
not
but
grow
faster
than
the
years
and
should
he
doubt
it
as
no
doubt
he
doth
that
i
should
open
to
the
listening
air
how
many
worthy
princes
bloods
were
shed
to
keep
his
bed
of
blackness
unlaid
ope
to
lop
that
doubt
he
ll
fill
this
land
with
arms
and
make
pretence
of
wrong
that
i
have
done
him
when
all
for
mine
if
i
may
call
offence
must
feel
war
s
blow
who
spares
not
innocence
which
love
to
all
of
which
thyself
art
one
who
now
reprovest
me
for
it
helicanus
alas
sir
pericles
drew
sleep
out
of
mine
eyes
blood
from
my
cheeks
musings
into
my
mind
with
thousand
doubts
how
i
might
stop
this
tempest
ere
it
came
and
finding
little
comfort
to
relieve
them
i
thought
it
princely
charity
to
grieve
them
helicanus
well
my
lord
since
you
have
given
me
leave
to
speak
freely
will
i
speak

why
as

the

eat
up
the

fitly

to
a
whale
a
plays
and
tumbles
driving
the
poor
fry
before
him

at

devours
them
all
at
a

swallowed

if
i
had

i
would
have

in

belfry
second
fisherman
why
man
third
fisherman
because
he
should
have
swallowed
me
too
and
when
i
had
been
in
his
belly
i
would
have
kept
such
a
jangling
of
the
bells
that
he
should
never
have
left
till
he
cast
bells
steeple
church
and
parish
up
again

if
the

simonides
were
of

simonides
to
you

sir
i
am
beholding

i
do
protest
my
ears
were
never

such
delightful
pleasing
harmony
pericles
it
is
your
grace
s
pleasure
to
commend
not

you
are

s
master
pericles
the
worst
of
all
her
scholars
my
good
lord
simonides
let
me
ask
you
one
thing
what
do
you
think
of
my
daughter
sir
pericles
a
most
virtuous
princess
simonides
and
she
is
fair
too
is
she
not
pericles
as
a
fair
day
in
summer
wondrous
fair
simonides
sir
my
daughter
thinks
very
well
of
you
ay
so
well
that
you
must
be
her
master
and
she
will
be
your
scholar
therefore
look
to
it
pericles
i
am
unworthy
for
her
schoolmaster
simonides
she
thinks
not
so
peruse
this
writing
else
pericles
[aside]
what
s
here
a
letter
that
she
loves
the
knight
of
tyre
tis
the
king
s
subtlety
to
have
my
life
o
seek
not
to
entrap
me
gracious
lord
a
stranger
and
distressed
gentleman
that
never
aim
d
so
high
to
love
your
daughter
but
bent
all
offices
to
honour
her
simonides
thou
hast
bewitch
d
my
daughter
and
thou
art
a
villain
pericles
by
the
gods
i
have
not
never
did
thought
of
mine
levy
offence
nor
never
did
my
actions
yet
commence
a
deed
might
gain
her
love
or
your
displeasure
simonides
traitor
thou
liest
pericles
traitor
simonides
ay
traitor
pericles
even
in
his
throat
unless
it
be
the
king
that
calls
me
traitor
i
return
the
lie
simonides
[aside]
now
by
the
gods
i
do
applaud
his
courage
pericles
my
actions
are
as
noble
as
my
thoughts
that
never
relish
d
of
a
base
descent
i
came
unto
your
court
for
honour
s
cause
and
not
to
be
a
rebel
to
her
state
and
he
that
otherwise
accounts
of
me
this
sword
shall
prove
he
s
honour
s
enemy
simonides
no
here
comes
my
daughter
she
can
witness
it
enter
thaisa
pericles
then
as
you
are
as
virtuous
as
fair
resolve
your
angry
father
if
my
tongue
did
ere
solicit
or
my
hand
subscribe
to
any
syllable
that
made
love
to
you
thaisa
why
sir
say
if
you
had
who
takes
offence
at
that
would
make
me
glad
simonides
yea
mistress
are
you
so
peremptory
aside
i
am
glad
on
t
with
all
my
heart
i

will
you
not
having
my

bestow
your
love

aside
who
for
aught
i
know
may
be
nor
can
i
think
the
contrary
as

that
is
the
cause
we
trouble
you
so
early
tis
not
our
husbandry
cerimon
o
you
say
well
first
gentleman
but
i
much
marvel
that
your
lordship
having
rich
tire
about
you
should
at
these
early
hours
shake
off
the
golden
slumber
of
repose
tis
most
strange

i
can
speak
of
the
disturbances

nature
works
and
of
her
cures
which
doth
give
me
a
more
content
in

of

to

not

so
my
lord
cerimon
how
close
tis

i
never
saw
so
huge
a
billow
sir
as
toss
d
it
upon

cerimon
wrench
it
open
soft
it
smells
most
sweetly
in
my
sense
second
gentleman
a
delicate
odour
cerimon
as
ever
hit
my
nostril
so
up
with
it
o
you
most
potent
gods
what

alack
that
monster
envy
oft
the
wrack
of

marina

seeks

and
in
this
kind
hath
our
cleon
one
daughter
and
a
wench
full
grown
even
ripe
for

rite
this
maid
hight
philoten
and
it
is
said
for
certain
in

story
she
would
ever
with
marina
be
be
t
when
she
weaved
the
sleided
silk
with
fingers
long
small
white
as
milk
or
when
she
would
with
sharp
needle
wound
the
cambric
which
she
made
more
sound
by
hurting
it
or
when
to
the
lute
she
sung
and
made
the
night
bird
mute
that
still
records
with
moan
or
when
she
would
with
rich
and
constant
pen
vail
to
her
mistress
dian
still
this
philoten
contends
in
skill
with
absolute
marina

with
the
dove
of
paphos

vie

white
marina
gets
all
praises

are
paid

you
how
she
came
dead

she
did
disdain
my

lysimachus
upon
what
ground
is
his
distemperature
helicanus
twould
be
too
tedious
to

the

may
we
not

where
do
you
live

how
achieved
you
these

you
make

thee
that
thou
camest
from

descending

to
injury

that
thou
thought

thy
griefs
might
equal

i
said

what
my
