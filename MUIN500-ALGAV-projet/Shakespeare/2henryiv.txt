mask
to
fright
our
party

how
doth
my
son
and
brother
thou
tremblest
and
the
whiteness
in
thy
cheek
is
apter
than
thy
tongue
to
tell
thy
errand
even
such
a
man
so
faint
so
spiritless
so
dull
so
dead
in
look
so
woe
begone
drew
priam
s
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
and
would
have
told
him
half
his
troy
was
burnt
but
priam
found
the
fire
ere
he
his
tongue
and
i
my
percy
s
death
ere
thou
report
st
it
this
thou
wouldst
say
your
son
did
thus
and
thus
your
brother
thus
so
fought
the
noble
douglas
stopping
my
greedy
ear
with
their
bold
deeds
but
in
the
end
to
stop
my
ear
indeed
thou
hast
a
sigh
to
blow
away
this
praise
ending
with
brother
son
and
all
are
dead
morton
douglas
is
living
and
your
brother
yet
but
for
my
lord
your
son
northumberland
why
he
is
dead
see
what
a
ready
tongue
suspicion
hath
he
that
but
fears
the
thing
he
would
not
know
hath
by
instinct
knowledge
from
others
eyes
that
what
he
fear
d
is
chanced
yet
speak
morton
tell
thou
an
earl
his
divination
lies
and
i
will
take
it
as
a
sweet
disgrace
and
make
thee
rich
for
doing
me
such
wrong
morton
you
are
too
great
to
be
by
me
gainsaid
your
spirit
is
too
true
your
fears
too
certain
northumberland
yet
for
all
this
say
not
that
percy
s
dead
i
see
a
strange
confession
in
thine
eye
thou
shakest
thy
head
and
hold
st
it
fear
or
sin
to
speak
a
truth
if
he
be
slain
say
so
the
tongue
offends
not
that
reports
his
death
and
he
doth
sin
that
doth
belie
the
dead
not
he
which
says
the
dead
is
not
alive
yet
the
first
bringer
of
unwelcome
news
hath
but
a
losing
office
and
his
tongue
sounds
ever
after
as
a
sullen
bell
remember
d
tolling
a
departing
friend
lord
bardolph
i
cannot
think
my
lord
your
son
is
dead
morton
i
am
sorry
i
should
force
you
to
believe
that
which
i
would
to
god
i
had
not
seen
but
these
mine
eyes
saw
him
in
bloody
state
rendering
faint
quittance
wearied
and
out
breathed
to
harry
monmouth
whose
swift
wrath
beat
down
the
never
daunted
percy
to
the
earth
from
whence
with
life
he
never
more
sprung
up
in
few
his
death
whose
spirit
lent
a
fire
even
to
the
dullest
peasant
in
his
camp
being
bruited
once
took
fire
and
heat
away
from
the
best
temper
d
courage
in
his
troops
for
from
his
metal
was
his
party
steel
d
which
once
in
him
abated
all
the
rest
turn
d
on
themselves
like
dull
and
heavy
lead
and
as
the
thing
that
s
heavy
in
itself
upon
enforcement
flies
with
greatest
speed
so
did
our
men
heavy
in
hotspur
s
loss
lend
to
this
weight
such
lightness
with
their
fear
that
arrows
fled
not
swifter
toward
their
aim
than
did
our
soldiers
aiming
at
their
safety
fly
from
the
field
then
was
the
noble
worcester
too
soon
ta
en
prisoner
and
that
furious
scot
the
bloody
douglas
whose
well
labouring
sword
had
three
times
slain
the
appearance
of
the
king
gan
vail
his
stomach
and
did
grace
the
shame
of
those
that
turn
d
their
backs
and
in
his
flight
stumbling
in
fear
was
took
the
sum
of
all
is
that
the
king
hath
won
and
hath
sent
out
a
speedy
power
to
encounter
you
my
lord
under
the
conduct
of
young
lancaster
and
westmoreland
this
is
the
news
at
full
northumberland
for
this
i
shall
have
time
enough
to
mourn
in
poison
there
is
physic
and
these
news
having
been
well
that
would
have
made
me
sick
being
sick
have
in
some
measure
made
me
well
and
as
the
wretch
whose
fever
weaken
d
joints
like
strengthless
hinges
buckle
under
life
impatient
of
his
fit
breaks
like
a
fire
out
of
his
keeper
s
arms
even
so
my
limbs
weaken
d
with
grief
being
now
enraged
with
grief
are
thrice
themselves
hence
therefore
thou
nice
crutch
a
scaly
gauntlet
now
with
joints
of
steel
must
glove
this
hand
and
hence
thou
sickly
quoif
thou
art
a
guard
too
wanton
for
the
head
which
princes
flesh
d
with
conquest
aim
to
hit
now
bind
my
brows
with
iron
and
approach
the
ragged
st
hour
that
time
and
spite
dare
bring
to
frown
upon
the
enraged
northumberland
let
heaven
kiss
earth
now
let
not
nature
s
hand
keep
the
wild
flood
confined
let
order
die
and
let
this
world
no
longer
be
a
stage
to
feed
contention
in
a
lingering
act
but
let
one
spirit
of
the
first
born
cain
reign
in
all
bosoms
that
each
heart
being
set
on
bloody
courses
the
rude
scene
may
end
and
darkness
be
the
burier
of
the
dead
travers
this
strained
passion
doth
you
wrong
my
lord
lord
bardolph
sweet
earl
divorce
not
wisdom
from
your
honour
morton
the
lives
of
all
your
loving
complices
lean
on
your
health
the
which
if
you
give
o

to
stormy
passion
must
perforce
decay
you
cast
the
event
of
war
my
noble
lord
and
summ
d
the
account
of
chance
before
you
said
let
us
make
head
it
was
your
presurmise
that
in
the
dole
of
blows
your
son
might
drop
you
knew
he
walk
d
o
er
perils
on
an
edge
more
likely
to
fall
in
than
to
get
o
er
you
were
advised
his
flesh
was
capable
of
wounds
and
scars
and
that
his
forward
spirit
would
lift
him
where
most
trade
of
danger
ranged
yet
did
you
say
go
forth
and
none
of
this
though
strongly
apprehended
could
restrain
the
stiff
borne
action
what
hath
then
befallen
or
what
hath
this
bold
enterprise
brought
forth
more
than
that
being
which
was
like
to
be
lord
bardolph
we
all
that
are
engaged
to
this
loss
knew
that
we
ventured
on
such
dangerous
seas
that
if
we
wrought
our
life
twas
ten
to
one
and
yet
we
ventured
for
the
gain
proposed
choked
the
respect
of
likely
peril

d
and
since
we
are
o
erset
venture
again
come
we
will
all
put
forth
body
and
goods
morton
tis
more
than
time
and
my
most
noble
lord
i
hear
for
certain
and
do
speak
the
truth
the
gentle
archbishop
of
york
is
up
with
well
appointed
powers
he
is
a
man
who
with
a
double
surety
binds
his
followers
my
lord
your
son
had
only
but
the
corpse
but
shadows
and
the
shows
of
men
to
fight
for
that
same
word
rebellion
did
divide
the
action
of
their
bodies
from
their
souls
and
they
did
fight
with
queasiness
constrain
d
as
men
drink
potions
that
their
weapons
only
seem
d
on
our
side
but
for
their
spirits
and
souls
this
word
rebellion
it
had
froze
them
up
as
fish
are
in
a
pond
but
now
the
bishop
turns
insurrection
to
religion
supposed
sincere
and
holy
in
his
thoughts
he
s
followed
both
with
body
and
with
mind
and
doth
enlarge
his
rising
with
the
blood
of
fair
king
richard
scraped

his
quarrel
and
his
cause
tells

he
doth
bestride
a
bleeding
land
gasping
for
life
under
great
bolingbroke
and
more
and
less
do
flock
to
follow
him
northumberland
i
knew
of
this
before
but
to
speak
truth
this
present
grief
had
wiped
it
from
my
mind
go
in
with
me
and
counsel
every
man
the
aptest
way
for
safety
and
revenge
get
posts

sirrah
you
giant
what
says
the
doctor
to
my
water
page
he
said
sir
the
water
itself
was
a
good
healthy
water
but
for
the
party
that
owed
it
he
might
have
more
diseases
than
he
knew
for
falstaff
men
of
all
sorts
take
a
pride
to
gird
at
me
the
brain
of
this
foolish
compounded
clay
man
is
not
able
to
invent
anything
that
tends
to
laughter
more
than
i
invent
or
is
invented
on
me
i
am
not
only
witty
in
myself
but
the
cause
that
wit
is
in
other
men
i
do
here
walk
before
thee
like
a
sow
that
hath
overwhelmed
all
her
litter
but
one
if
the
prince
put
thee
into
my
service
for
any
other
reason
than
to
set
me
off
why
then
i
have
no
judgment
thou
whoreson
mandrake
thou
art
fitter
to
be
worn
in
my
cap
than
to
wait
at
my
heels
i
was
never
manned
with
an
agate
till
now
but
i
will
inset
you
neither
in
gold
nor
silver
but
in
vile
apparel
and
send
you
back
again
to
your
master
for
a
jewel
the
juvenal
the
prince
your
master
whose
chin
is

fledged
i
will
sooner
have
a
beard
grow
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
than
he
shall
get
one
on
his
cheek
and
yet
he
will
not
stick
to
say
his
face
is
a
face
royal
god
may
finish
it
when
he
will
tis
not
a
hair
amiss
yet
he
may
keep
it
still
at
a
face
royal
for
a
barber
shall
never
earn
sixpence
out
of
it
and
yet
he
ll
be
crowing
as
if
he
had
writ
man
ever
since
his
father
was
a
bachelor
he
may
keep
his
own
grace
but
he
s
almost
out
of
mine
i
can
assure
him
what
said
master
dombledon
about
the
satin
for
my
short
cloak
and
my
slops
page
he
said
sir
you
should
procure
him
better
assurance
than
bardolph
he
would
not
take
his
band
and
yours
he
liked
not
the

let
him
be
damned
like
the

his

yea
forsooth
knave
to

the

smooth
pates
do
now
wear
nothing

high
shoes
and
bunches
of

at
their

and
if
a

is
through
with
them
in
honest
taking
up
then
they
must
stand
upon
security
i
had
as
lief
they
would
put
ratsbane
in

mouth
as

good
time
of
day
i
am
glad
to
see
your

abroad
i
heard

your
lordship
was
sick
i
hope
your
lordship
goes
abroad
by
advice
your
lordship
though
not
clean
past
your
youth
hath
yet
some
smack
of
age
in
you
some
relish
of
the
saltness
of
time
and
i
must
humbly
beseech
your
lordship
to
have
a
reverent
care
of
your
health
lord
chief
justice
sir
john
i
sent
for
you
before
your
expedition
to
shrewsbury
falstaff
an
t
please
your
lordship
i
hear
his
majesty
is
returned
with
some
discomfort
from
wales
lord
chief
justice
i
talk
not
of
his
majesty
you
would
not
come
when
i
sent
for
you
falstaff
and
i
hear
moreover
his
highness
is
fallen
into
this
same
whoreson
apoplexy
lord
chief
justice
well
god
mend
him
i
pray
you
let
me
speak
with
you
falstaff
this
apoplexy
is
as
i
take
it
a
kind
of
lethargy
an
t
please
your
lordship
a
kind
of
sleeping
in
the
blood
a
whoreson
tingling
lord
chief
justice
what
tell
you
me
of
it
be
it
as
it
is
falstaff
it
hath
its
original
from
much
grief
from
study
and
perturbation
of
the
brain
i
have
read
the
cause
of
his
effects
in
galen
it
is
a
kind
of
deafness
lord
chief
justice
i
think
you
are
fallen
into
the
disease
for
you
hear
not
what
i
say
to
you
falstaff
very
well
my
lord
very
well
rather
an
t
please
you
it
is
the
disease
of
not
listening
the
malady
of
not
marking
that
i
am
troubled
withal
lord
chief
justice
to
punish
you
by
the
heels
would
amend
the
attention
of
your
ears
and
i
care
not
if
i
do
become
your
physician
falstaff
i
am
as
poor
as
job
my
lord
but
not
so
patient
your
lordship
may
minister
the
potion
of
imprisonment
to
me
in
respect
of
poverty
but
how
should
i
be
your
patient
to
follow
your
prescriptions
the
wise
may
make
some
dram
of
a
scruple
or
indeed
a
scruple
itself
lord
chief
justice
i
sent
for
you
when
there
were
matters
against
you
for
your
life
to
come
speak
with
me
falstaff
as
i
was
then
advised
by
my
learned
counsel
in
the
laws
of
this
land
service
i
did
not
come
lord
chief
justice
well
the
truth
is
sir
john
you
live
in
great
infamy
falstaff
he
that
buckles
him
in
my
belt
cannot
live
in
less
lord
chief
justice
your
means
are
very
slender
and
your
waste
is
great
falstaff
i
would
it
were
otherwise
i
would
my
means
were
greater
and
my
waist
slenderer
lord
chief
justice
you
have
misled
the
youthful
prince
falstaff
the
young
prince
hath
misled
me
i
am
the
fellow
with
the
great
belly
and
he
my
dog
lord
chief
justice
well
i
am
loath
to
gall
a
new
healed
wound
your
day
s
service
at
shrewsbury
hath
a
little
gilded
over
your
night
s
exploit
on
gad
s
hill
you
may
thank
the
unquiet
time
for
your
quiet
o
er
posting
that
action
falstaff
my
lord
lord
chief
justice
but
since
all
is
well
keep
it
so
wake
not
a
sleeping
wolf
falstaff
to
wake
a
wolf
is
as
bad
as
to
smell
a
fox
lord
chief
justice
what
you
are
as
a
candle
the
better
part
burnt
out
falstaff
a
wassail
candle
my
lord
all
tallow
if
i
did
say
of
wax
my
growth
would
approve
the
truth
lord
chief
justice
there
is
not
a
white
hair
on
your
face
but
should
have
his
effect
of
gravity
falstaff
his
effect
of
gravy
gravy
gravy
lord
chief
justice
you
follow
the
young
prince
up
and
down
like
his
ill
angel
falstaff
not
so
my
lord
your
ill
angel
is
light
but
i
hope
he
that
looks
upon
me
will
take
me
without
weighing
and
yet
in
some
respects
i
grant
i
cannot
go
i
cannot
tell
virtue
is
of
so
little
regard
in
these
costermonger
times
that
true
valour
is
turned
bear
herd
pregnancy
is
made
a
tapster
and
hath
his
quick
wit
wasted
in
giving
reckonings
all
the
other
gifts
appertinent
to
man
as
the
malice
of
this
age
shapes
them
are
not
worth
a
gooseberry
you
that
are
old
consider
not
the
capacities
of
us
that
are
young
you
do
measure
the
heat
of
our
livers
with
the
bitterness
of
your
galls
and
we
that
are
in
the
vaward
of
our
youth
i
must
confess
are
wags
too
lord
chief
justice
do
you
set
down
your
name
in
the
scroll
of
youth
that
are
written
down
old
with
all
the
characters
of

have
you
not

not
your

call
yourself

sir
john
falstaff
my
lord
i
was
born
about
three
of
the
clock
in
the
afternoon
with
a
white
head
and
something
a
round
belly
for
my
voice
i
have
lost
it
with
halloing
and
singing
of
anthems
to
approve
my
youth
further
i
will
not
the
truth
is
i
am
only
old
in
judgment
and
understanding
and
he
that
will
caper
with
me
for
a
thousand
marks
let
him
lend
me
the
money
and
have
at
him
for
the
box
of
the
ear
that
the
prince
gave
you
he
gave
it
like
a
rude
prince
and
you
took
it
like
a
sensible
lord
i
have
chequed
him
for
it
and
the
young
lion
repents
marry
not
in
ashes
and
sackcloth

there

a
dangerous
action

peep
out
his
head
but
i
am
thrust
upon
it
well
i
cannot
last
ever
but
it
was
alway
yet
the
trick
of
our
english
nation

a
good
thing
to
make
it
too
common
if
ye

were
better
to

no
more
separate
age

a
can
part

limbs

lechery

galls

archbishop
of

thus
have
you
heard
our

known
our

and
my
most
noble
friends
i
pray
you
all
speak
plainly
your
opinions
of
our
hopes
and
first
lord
marshal
what
say
you
to
it
mowbray
i
well
allow
the
occasion
of
our
arms
but
gladly
would
be
better
satisfied
how
in
our
means
we
should
advance
ourselves
to
look
with
forehead
bold
and
big
enough
upon
the
power
and
puissance
of
the
king
hastings
our
present
musters
grow
upon
the
file
to
five
and
twenty
thousand
men
of
choice
and
our
supplies
live
largely
in
the
hope
of
great
northumberland
whose
bosom
burns
with
an
incensed
fire
of
injuries
lord
bardolph
the
question
then
lord
hastings
standeth
thus
whether
our
present
five
and
twenty
thousand
may
hold
up
head
without
northumberland
hastings
with
him
we
may
lord
bardolph
yea
marry
there
s
the
point
but
if
without
him
we
be
thought
too
feeble
my
judgment
is
we
should
not
step
too
far
till
we
had
his
assistance
by
the
hand
for
in
a
theme
so
bloody
faced
as
this
conjecture
expectation
and
surmise
of
aids
incertain
should
not
be
admitted
archbishop
of
york
tis
very
true
lord
bardolph
for
indeed
it
was
young
hotspur
s
case
at
shrewsbury
lord
bardolph
it
was
my
lord
who
lined
himself
with
hope
eating
the
air
on
promise
of
supply
flattering
himself
in
project
of
a
power
much
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
his
thoughts
and
so
with
great
imagination
proper
to
madmen
led
his
powers
to
death
and
winking
leap
d
into
destruction
hastings
but
by
your
leave
it
never
yet
did
hurt
to
lay
down
likelihoods
and
forms
of
hope
lord
bardolph
yes
if
this
present
quality
of
war
indeed
the
instant
action
a
cause
on
foot
lives
so
in
hope
as
in
an
early
spring
we
see
the
appearing
buds
which
to
prove
fruit
hope
gives
not
so
much
warrant
as
despair
that
frosts
will
bite
them
when
we
mean
to
build
we
first
survey
the
plot
then
draw
the
model
and
when
we
see
the
figure
of
the
house
then
must
we
rate
the
cost
of
the
erection
which
if
we
find
outweighs
ability
what
do
we
then
but
draw
anew
the
model
in
fewer
offices
or
at
last
desist
to
build
at
all
much
more
in
this
great
work
which
is
almost
to
pluck
a
kingdom
down
and
set
another
up
should
we
survey
the
plot
of
situation
and
the
model
consent
upon
a
sure
foundation
question
surveyors
know
our
own
estate
how
able
such
a
work
to
undergo
to
weigh
against
his
opposite
or
else
we
fortify
in
paper
and
in
figures
using
the
names
of
men
instead
of
men
like
one
that
draws
the
model
of
a
house
beyond
his
power
to
build
it
who
half
through
gives
o
er
and
leaves
his
part
created
cost
a
naked
subject
to
the
weeping
clouds
and
waste
for
churlish
winter
s
tyranny
hastings
grant
that
our
hopes
yet
likely
of
fair
birth
should
be
still
born
and
that
we
now
possess
d
the
utmost
man
of
expectation
i
think
we
are
a
body
strong
enough
even
as
we
are
to
equal
with
the
king
lord
bardolph
what
is
the
king
but
five
and
twenty
thousand
hastings
to
us
no
more
nay
not
so
much
lord
bardolph
for
his
divisions
as
the
times
do
brawl
are
in
three
heads
one
power
against
the
french
and
one
against
glendower
perforce
a
third
must
take
up
us
so
is
the
unfirm
king
in
three
divided
and
his
coffers
sound
with
hollow
poverty
and
emptiness
archbishop
of
york
that
he
should
draw
his
several
strengths
together
and
come
against
us
in
full
puissance
need
not
be
dreaded
hastings
if
he
should
do
so
he
leaves
his
back
unarm
d
the
french
and
welsh
baying
him
at
the
heels
never
fear
that
lord
bardolph
who
is
it
like
should
lead
his
forces
hither

the
duke
of
lancaster
and
westmoreland
against
the
welsh
himself
and

who

i

no

archbishop
of

let
us
on
and
publish
the
occasion
of
our

the
commonwealth
is
sick
of
their

their
over
greedy

giddy

exeunt
scene
ii
london
another
street
enter
prince
henry
and
poins
prince
henry
before
god
i
am
exceeding
weary
poins
is
t
come
to
that
i
had
thought
weariness
durst
not
have
attached
one
of
so
high
blood
prince
henry
faith
it
does
me
though
it
discolours
the
complexion
of
my
greatness
to
acknowledge
it
doth
it
not
show
vilely
in
me
to
desire
small
beer
poins
why
a
prince
should
not
be
so
loosely
studied
as
to
remember
so
weak
a
composition
prince
henry
belike
then
my
appetite
was
not
princely
got
for
by
my
troth
i
do
now
remember
the
poor
creature
small
beer
but
indeed
these
humble
considerations
make
me
out
of
love
with
my
greatness
what
a
disgrace
is
it
to
me
to
remember
thy
name
or
to
know
thy
face
to
morrow
or
to
take
note
how
many
pair
of
silk
stockings
thou
hast
viz
these
and
those
that
were
thy
peach
coloured
ones
or
to
bear
the
inventory
of
thy
shirts
as
one
for
superfluity
and
another
for
use
but
that
the
tennis
court
keeper
knows
better
than
i
for
it
is
a
low
ebb
of
linen
with
thee
when
thou
keepest
not
racket
there
as
thou
hast
not
done
a
great
while
because
the
rest
of
thy
low
countries
have
made
a
shift
to
eat
up
thy
holland
and
god
knows
whether
those
that
bawl
out
the
ruins
of
thy
linen
shall
inherit
his
kingdom
but
the
midwives
say
the
children
are
not
in
the
fault
whereupon
the
world
increases
and
kindreds
are
mightily
strengthened
poins
how
ill
it
follows
after
you
have
laboured
so
hard
you
should
talk
so
idly
tell
me
how
many
good
young
princes
would
do
so
their
fathers
being
so
sick
as
yours
at
this
time
is
prince
henry
shall
i
tell
thee
one
thing
poins
poins
yes
faith
and
let
it
be
an
excellent
good
thing
prince
henry
it
shall
serve
among
wits
of
no
higher
breeding
than
thine
poins
go
to
i
stand
the
push
of
your
one
thing
that
you
will
tell
prince
henry
marry
i
tell
thee
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
be
sad
now
my
father
is
sick
albeit
i
could
tell
thee
as
to
one
it
pleases
me
for
fault
of
a
better
to
call
my
friend
i
could
be
sad
and
sad
indeed
too
poins
very
hardly
upon
such
a
subject
prince
henry
by
this
hand
thou
thinkest
me
as
far
in
the
devil
s
book
as
thou
and
falstaff
for
obduracy
and
persistency
let
the
end
try
the
man
but
i
tell
thee
my
heart
bleeds
inwardly
that
my
father
is
so
sick
and
keeping
such
vile
company
as
thou
art
hath
in
reason
taken
from
me
all
ostentation
of
sorrow
poins
the
reason
prince
henry
what
wouldst
thou
think
of
me
if
i
should
weep
poins
i
would
think
thee
a
most
princely
hypocrite
prince
henry
it
would
be
every
man
s
thought
and
thou
art
a
blessed
fellow
to
think
as
every
man
thinks
never
a
man
s
thought
in
the
world
keeps
the
road
way
better
than
thine
every
man
would
think
me
an
hypocrite
indeed
and
what
accites
your
most
worshipful
thought
to
think
so
poins
why
because
you
have
been
so
lewd
and
so
much
engraffed
to
falstaff
prince
henry
and
to
thee
poins
by
this
light
i
am
well
spoke
on
i
can
hear
it
with
my
own
ears
the
worst
that
they
can
say
of
me
is
that
i
am
a
second
brother
and
that
i
am
a
proper
fellow
of
my
hands
and
those
two
things
i
confess
i
cannot

for

go
not
to
these

the
time
was
father
that
you
broke
your
word
when
you
were
more
endeared
to
it
than
now
when
your
own
percy
when
my
heart
s
dear
harry
threw
many
a
northward
look
to
see
his
father
bring
up
his
powers
but
he
did
long
in
vain
who
then
persuaded
you
to
stay
at
home
there
were
two
honours
lost
yours
and
your
son
s
for
yours
the
god
of
heaven
brighten
it
for
his
it
stuck
upon
him
as
the
sun
in
the
grey
vault
of
heaven
and
by
his
light
did
all
the
chivalry
of
england
move
to
do
brave
acts
he
was
indeed
the
glass
wherein
the
noble
youth
did
dress
themselves
he
had
no
legs
that
practised
not
his
gait
and
speaking
thick
which
nature
made
his
blemish
became
the
accents
of
the
valiant
for
those
that
could
speak
low
and
tardily
would
turn
their
own
perfection
to
abuse
to
seem
like
him
so
that
in
speech
in
gait
in
diet
in
affections
of
delight
in
military
rules
humours
of
blood
he
was
the
mark
and
glass
copy
and

that
fashion
d
others
and
him
o
wondrous
him
o
miracle
of
men
him
did
you
leave
second
to
none
unseconded
by
you
to
look
upon
the
hideous
god
of
war
in
disadvantage
to
abide
a
field
where
nothing
but
the
sound
of
hotspur
s
name
did
seem
defensible
so
you
left
him
never
o
never
do
his
ghost
the
wrong
to
hold
your
honour
more
precise
and
nice
with
others
than
with
him

have
you
read
o
er
the
letters
that
i
sent
you

we
have
my
liege
king
henry

then
you
perceive
the
body
of
our
kingdom
how
foul
it
is
what
rank
diseases
grow
and
with
what
danger
near
the
heart
of
it
warwick
it
is
but
as
a
body
yet
distemper
d
which
to
his
former
strength
may
be
restored
with
good
advice
and
little
medicine
my
lord
northumberland
will
soon
be
cool
d
king
henry
iv
o
god
that
one
might
read
the
book
of
fate
and
see
the
revolution
of
the
times
make
mountains
level
and
the
continent
weary
of
solid
firmness
melt
itself
into
the
sea
and
other
times
to
see
the
beachy
girdle
of
the
ocean
too
wide
for
neptune
s
hips
how
chances
mock
and
changes
fill
the
cup
of
alteration
with
divers
liquors
o
if
this
were
seen
the
happiest
youth
viewing
his
progress
through
what
perils
past
what
crosses
to
ensue
would
shut
the
book
and
sit
him
down
and
die
tis
not
ten
years
gone
since
richard
and
northumberland
great
friends
did
feast
together
and
in
two
years
after
were
they
at
wars
it
is
but
eight
years
since
this
percy
was
the
man
nearest
my
soul
who
like
a
brother
toil
d
in
my
affairs
and
laid
his
love
and
life
under
my
foot
yea
for
my
sake
even
to
the
eyes
of
richard
gave
him
defiance
but
which
of
you
was
by
you
cousin
nevil
as
i
may
remember
to
warwick
when
richard
with
his
eye
brimful
of
tears
then
cheque
d
and
rated
by
northumberland
did
speak
these
words
now
proved
a
prophecy
northumberland
thou
ladder
by
the
which
my
cousin
bolingbroke
ascends
my
throne
though
then
god
knows
i
had
no
such
intent
but
that
necessity
so
bow
d
the
state
that
i
and
greatness
were
compell
d
to
kiss
the
time
shall
come
thus
did
he
follow
it
the
time
will
come
that
foul
sin
gathering
head
shall
break
into
corruption
so
went
on
foretelling
this
same
time
s
condition
and
the
division
of
our
amity
warwick
there
is
a
history
in
all
men
s
lives
figuring
the
nature
of
the
times
deceased
the
which
observed
a
man
may
prophesy
with
a
near
aim
of
the
main
chance
of
things
as
yet
not
come
to
life
which
in
their
seeds
and
weak
beginnings
lie
intreasured
such
things
become
the
hatch
and
brood
of
time
and
by
the
necessary
form
of
this
king
richard
might
create
a
perfect
guess
that
great
northumberland
then
false
to
him
would
of
that
seed
grow
to
a
greater
falseness
which
should
not
find
a
ground

hath
done
nothing
but
prate
to
me
of
the
wildness
of
his
youth
and
the
feats
he
hath
done
about
turnbull
street
and
every
third
word
a
lie
duer
paid
to
the
hearer
than
the
turk
s
tribute
i
do
remember
him
at
clement
s
inn
like
a
man
made
after
supper
of
a
cheese
paring
when
a
was
naked
he
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
forked
radish
with
a
head
fantastically
carved
upon
it
with
a
knife
a
was
so
forlorn
that
his
dimensions
to
any
thick
sight
were
invincible
a
was
the
very
genius
of
famine
yet
lecherous
as
a
monkey
and
the
whores
called
him
mandrake
a
came
ever
in
the
rearward
of
the
fashion
and
sung
those
tunes
to
the
overscutched
huswives
that
he
heard
the
carmen
whistle
and
swear
they
were
his
fancies
or
his
good
nights
and
now
is
this
vice
s
dagger
become
a
squire
and
talks
as
familiarly
of
john
a
gaunt
as
if
he
had
been
sworn
brother
to
him
and
i
ll
be
sworn
a
ne
er
saw
him
but
once
in
the
tilt
yard
and
then
he
burst
his
head
for
crowding
among
the
marshal
s
men
i
saw
it
and
told
john
a
gaunt
he
beat
his
own
name
for
you
might
have
thrust
him
and
all
his
apparel
into
an
eel
skin
the
case
of
a
treble
hautboy
was
a
mansion
for
him
a
court
and
now
has
he
land
and
beefs
well
i
ll
be
acquainted
with
him
if
i
return
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
will
make
him
a
philosopher

two
stones
to
me
if
the
young
dace
be
a
bait
for
the
old
pike
i
see
no

already
archbishop

tis
well
done
my
friends
and
brethren
in
these
great
affairs
i
must
acquaint
you
that
i
have
received
new
dated
letters
from
northumberland
their
cold
intent
tenor
and
substance
thus
here
doth
he
wish
his
person
with
such
powers
as
might
hold
sortance
with
his
quality
the
which
he
could
not
levy
whereupon
he
is
retired
to
ripe
his
growing
fortunes
to
scotland
and
concludes
in
hearty
prayers
that
your
attempts
may
overlive
the
hazard
and
fearful
melting
of
their
opposite
mowbray
thus
do
the
hopes

have
in
him
touch
ground
and
dash
themselves
to
pieces
enter
a
messenger
hastings
now
what
news
messenger
west
of
this
forest
scarcely
off
a
mile
in
goodly
form
comes
on
the
enemy
and
by
the
ground
they
hide
i
judge
their
number
upon
or
near
the
rate
of
thirty
thousand
mowbray
the
just
proportion
that
we
gave
them
out
let
us
sway
on
and
face
them
in
the
field
archbishop
of
york
what
well
appointed
leader
fronts
us
here
enter
westmoreland
mowbray
i
think
it
is
my
lord
of
westmoreland
westmoreland
health
and
fair
greeting
from
our
general
the
prince
lord
john
and
duke
of
lancaster
archbishop
of
york
say
on
my
lord
of
westmoreland
in
peace
what
doth
concern
your
coming
westmoreland
then
my
lord
unto
your
grace
do
i
in
chief
address
the
substance
of
my
speech
if
that
rebellion
came
like
itself
in
base
and
abject
routs
led
on
by
bloody
youth
guarded
with
rags
and
countenanced
by
boys
and
beggary
i
say
if
damn
d
commotion
so
appear
d
in
his
true
native
and
most
proper
shape
you
reverend
father
and
these
noble
lords
had
not
been
here
to
dress
the
ugly
form
of
base
and
bloody
insurrection
with
your
fair
honours
you
lord
archbishop
whose
see
is
by
a
civil
peace
maintained
whose
beard
the
silver
hand
of
peace
hath
touch
d
whose
learning
and
good
letters
peace
hath
tutor
d
whose
white
investments
figure
innocence
the
dove
and
very
blessed
spirit
of
peace
wherefore
do
you
so
ill
translate
ourself
out
of
the
speech
of
peace
that
bears
such
grace
into
the
harsh
and
boisterous
tongue
of
war
turning
your
books
to
graves
your
ink
to
blood
your
pens
to
lances
and
your
tongue
divine
to
a
trumpet
and
a
point
of
war
archbishop
of
york
wherefore
do
i
this
so
the
question
stands
briefly
to
this
end
we
are
all
diseased
and
with
our
surfeiting
and
wanton
hours
have
brought
ourselves
into
a
burning
fever
and
we
must
bleed
for
it
of
which
disease
our
late
king
richard
being
infected
died
but
my
most
noble
lord
of
westmoreland
i
take
not
on
me
here
as
a
physician
nor
do
i
as
an
enemy
to
peace
troop
in
the
throngs
of
military
men
but
rather
show
awhile
like
fearful
war
to
diet
rank
minds
sick
of
happiness
and
purge
the
obstructions
which
begin
to
stop
our
very
veins
of
life
hear
me
more
plainly
i
have
in
equal
balance
justly
weigh
d
what
wrongs
our
arms
may
do
what
wrongs
we
suffer
and
find
our
griefs
heavier
than
our
offences
we
see
which
way
the
stream
of
time
doth
run
and
are
enforced
from
our
most
quiet
there
by
the
rough
torrent
of
occasion
and
have
the
summary
of
all
our
griefs
when
time
shall
serve
to
show
in
articles
which
long
ere
this
we
offer
d
to
the
king
and
might
by
no
suit
gain
our
audience
when
we
are
wrong
d
and
would
unfold
our
griefs
we
are
denied
access
unto
his
person
even
by
those
men
that
most
have
done
us
wrong
the
dangers
of
the
days
but
newly
gone
whose
memory
is
written
on
the
earth
with
yet
appearing
blood
and
the
examples
of
every
minute
s
instance
present
now
hath
put
us
in
these
ill
beseeming
arms
not
to
break
peace
or
any
branch
of
it
but
to
establish
here
a
peace
indeed
concurring
both
in
name
and
quality
westmoreland
when
ever
yet
was
your
appeal
denied
wherein
have
you
been
galled
by
the
king
what
peer
hath
been
suborn
d
to
grate
on
you
that
you
should
seal
this
lawless
bloody
book
of
forged
rebellion
with
a
seal
divine
and
consecrate
commotion
s
bitter
edge
archbishop
of
york
my
brother
general
the
commonwealth
to
brother
born
an
household
cruelty
i
make
my
quarrel
in
particular
westmoreland
there
is
no
need
of
any
such
redress
or
if
there
were
it
not
belongs
to
you
mowbray
why
not
to
him
in
part
and
to
us
all
that
feel
the
bruises
of
the
days
before
and
suffer
the
condition
of
these
times
to
lay
a
heavy
and
unequal
hand
upon
our
honours
westmoreland
o
my
good
lord
mowbray
construe
the
times
to
their
necessities
and
you
shall
say
indeed
it
is
the
time
and
not
the
king
that
doth
you
injuries
yet
for
your
part
it
not
appears
to
me
either
from
the
king
or
in
the
present
time
that
you
should
have
an
inch
of
any
ground
to
build
a
grief
on
were
you
not
restored
to
all
the
duke
of
norfolk
s
signories
your
noble
and
right
well
remember
d
father
s
mowbray
what
thing
in
honour
had
my
father
lost
that
need
to
be
revived
and
breathed
in
me
the
king
that
loved
him
as
the
state
stood
then
was
force
perforce
compell
d
to
banish
him
and
then
that
harry
bolingbroke
and
he
being
mounted
and
both
roused
in
their
seats
their
neighing
coursers
daring
of
the
spur
their
armed
staves
in
charge
their
beavers
down
their
eyes
of
fire
sparking
through
sights
of
steel
and
the
loud
trumpet
blowing
them
together
then
then
when
there
was
nothing
could
have
stay
d
my
father
from
the
breast
of
bolingbroke
o
when
the
king
did
throw
his
warder
down
his
own
life
hung
upon
the
staff
he
threw
then
threw
he
down
himself
and
all
their
lives
that
by
indictment
and
by
dint
of
sword
have
since
miscarried
under
bolingbroke
westmoreland
you
speak
lord
mowbray
now
you
know
not
what
the
earl
of
hereford
was
reputed
then
in
england
the
most
valiant
gentlemen
who
knows
on
whom
fortune
would
then
have
smiled
but
if
your
father
had
been
victor
there
he
ne
er
had
borne
it
out
of
coventry
for
all
the
country
in
a
general
voice
cried
hate
upon
him
and
all
their
prayers
and
love
were
set
on
hereford
whom
they
doted
on
and
bless
d
and
graced
indeed
more
than
the
king
but
this
is
mere
digression
from
my
purpose
here
come
i
from
our
princely
general
to
know
your
griefs
to
tell
you
from
his
grace
that
he
will
give
you
audience
and
wherein
it
shall
appear
that
your
demands
are
just
you
shall
enjoy
them
every
thing
set
off
that
might
so
much
as
think
you
enemies
mowbray
but
he
hath
forced
us
to
compel
this
offer
and
it
proceeds
from
policy
not
love
westmoreland
mowbray
you
overween
to
take
it
so
this
offer
comes
from
mercy
not
from
fear
for
lo
within
a
ken
our
army
lies
upon
mine
honour
all
too
confident
to
give
admittance
to
a
thought
of
fear
our
battle
is
more
full
of
names
than
yours
our
men
more
perfect
in
the
use
of
arms
our
armour
all
as
strong
our
cause
the
best
then
reason
will
our
heart
should
be
as
good
say
you
not
then
our
offer
is
compell
d
mowbray
well
by
my
will
we
shall
admit
no
parley
westmoreland
that
argues
but
the
shame
of
your
offence
a
rotten
case
abides
no
handling
hastings
hath
the
prince
john
a
full
commission
in
very
ample
virtue
of
his
father
to
hear
and
absolutely
to
determine
of
what
conditions
we
shall
stand
upon
westmoreland
that
is
intended
in
the
general
s
name
i
muse
you
make
so
slight
a
question
archbishop
of
york
then
take
my
lord
of
westmoreland
this
schedule
for
this
contains
our
general
grievances
each
several
article
herein
redress
d
all
members
of
our
cause
both
here
and
hence
that
are
insinew
d
to
this
action
acquitted
by
a
true
substantial
form
and
present
execution
of
our
wills
to
us
and
to
our
purposes
confined
we
come
within
our
awful
banks
again
and
knit
our
powers
to
the
arm
of
peace
westmoreland
this
will
i
show
the
general
please
you
lords
in
sight
of
both
our
battles
we
may
meet
and
either
end
in
peace
which
god
so
frame
or
to
the
place
of
difference
call
the
swords
which
must
decide
it
archbishop
of
york
my
lord
we
will
do
so
exit
westmoreland
mowbray
there
is
a
thing
within
my
bosom
tells
me
that
no
conditions
of
our
peace
can
stand
hastings
fear
you
not
that
if
we
can
make
our
peace
upon
such
large
terms
and
so
absolute
as
our
conditions
shall
consist
upon
our
peace
shall
stand
as
firm
as
rocky
mountains
mowbray
yea
but
our
valuation
shall
be
such
that
every
slight
and
false
derived
cause
yea
every
idle
nice
and
wanton
reason
shall
to
the
king
taste
of
this
action
that
were
our
royal
faiths
martyrs
in
love
we
shall
be
winnow
d
with
so
rough
a
wind
that
even
our
corn
shall
seem
as
light
as
chaff
and
good
from
bad
find
no
partition
archbishop
of
york
no
no
my
lord
note
this
the
king
is
weary
of
dainty
and
such
picking
grievances
for
he
hath
found
to
end
one
doubt
by
death
revives
two
greater
in
the
heirs
of
life
and
therefore
will
he
wipe
his
tables
clean
and
keep
no
tell
tale
to
his
memory
that
may
repeat
and
history
his
loss
to
new
remembrance
for
full
well
he
knows
he
cannot
so
precisely
weed
this
land
as
his
misdoubts
present
occasion
his
foes
are
so
enrooted
with
his
friends
that
plucking
to
unfix
an
enemy
he
doth
unfasten
so
and
shake
a
friend
so
that
this
land
like
an
offensive
wife
that
hath
enraged
him
on
to
offer
strokes
as
he
is
striking
holds
his
infant
up
and
hangs
resolved
correction
in
the
arm
that
was
uprear
d
to
execution
hastings
besides
the
king
hath
wasted
all
his
rods
on
late
offenders
that
he
now
doth
lack
the
very
instruments
of
chastisement
so
that
his
power
like
to
a
fangless
lion
may
offer
but
not
hold
archbishop
of
york
tis
very
true
and
therefore
be
assured
my
good
lord
marshal
if
we
do
now
make
our
atonement
well
our
peace
will
like
a
broken
limb
united
grow
stronger
for
the
breaking
mowbray
be
it

i
would
you
had
but
the
wit
twere
better
than
your
dukedom
good
faith
this
same
young
sober
blooded
boy
doth
not
love
me
nor
a
man
cannot
make
him
laugh
but
that
s
no
marvel
he
drinks
no
wine
there
s
never
none
of
these
demure
boys
come
to
any
proof
for
thin
drink
doth
so
over
cool
their
blood
and
making
many
fish
meals
that
they
fall
into
a
kind
of
male
green
sickness
and
then
when
they
marry
they
get
wenches
they
are
generally
fools
and
cowards
which
some
of
us
should
be
too
but
for
inflammation
a
good
sherris
sack
hath
a
two
fold
operation
in
it
it
ascends
me
into
the
brain
dries
me
there
all
the
foolish
and
dull
and
curdy
vapours
which
environ
it
makes
it
apprehensive
quick
forgetive
full
of
nimble
fiery
and
delectable
shapes
which
delivered
o
er
to
the
voice
the
tongue
which
is
the
birth
becomes
excellent
wit
the
second
property
of
your
excellent
sherris
is
the
warming
of
the
blood
which
before
cold
and
settled
left
the
liver
white
and
pale
which
is
the
badge
of
pusillanimity
and
cowardice
but
the
sherris
warms
it
and
makes
it
course
from
the
inwards
to
the
parts
extreme
it
illumineth
the
face
which
as
a
beacon
gives
warning
to
all
the
rest
of
this
little
kingdom
man
to
arm
and
then
the
vital
commoners
and
inland
petty
spirits
muster
me
all
to
their
captain
the
heart
who
great
and
puffed
up
with
this
retinue
doth
any
deed
of
courage
and
this
valour
comes
of
sherris
so
that
skill
in
the
weapon
is
nothing
without
sack
for
that
sets
it
a
work
and
learning
a
mere
hoard
of
gold
kept
by
a
devil
till
sack
commences
it
and
sets
it
in
act
and
use
hereof
comes
it
that
prince
harry
is
valiant
for
the
cold
blood
he
did
naturally
inherit
of
his
father
he
hath
like
lean
sterile
and
bare
land
manured
husbanded
and
tilled
with
excellent
endeavour
of
drinking
good
and
good
store
of
fertile
sherris
that
he
is
become
very
hot
and
valiant
if
i
had
a
thousand
sons
the
first
humane
principle
i
would
teach

should
be
to
forswear

do
not

not
his

thomas
of

with
him

no
my
good
lord
he
is
in

here
clarence
what
would
my
lord
and
father
king
henry

nothing
but
well
to
thee
thomas
of
clarence
how
chance
thou
art
not
with
the
prince
thy
brother
he
loves
thee
and
thou
dost
neglect
him
thomas
thou
hast
a
better
place
in
his
affection
than
all
thy
brothers
cherish
it
my
boy
and
noble
offices
thou
mayst
effect
of
mediation
after
i
am
dead
between
his
greatness
and
thy
other
brethren
therefore
omit
him
not
blunt
not
his
love
nor
lose
the
good
advantage
of
his
grace
by
seeming
cold
or
careless
of
his
will
for
he
is
gracious
if
he
be
observed
he
hath
a
tear
for
pity
and
a
hand
open
as
day
for
melting
charity
yet
notwithstanding
being
incensed
he
s
flint
as
humorous
as
winter
and
as
sudden
as
flaws
congealed
in
the
spring
of
day
his
temper
therefore
must
be
well
observed
chide
him
for
faults
and
do
it
reverently
when
thou
perceive
his
blood
inclined
to
mirth
but
being
moody
give
him
line
and
scope
till
that
his
passions
like
a
whale
on
ground
confound
themselves
with
working
learn
this
thomas
and
thou
shalt
prove
a
shelter
to
thy
friends
a
hoop
of
gold
to
bind
thy
brothers
in
that
the
united
vessel
of
their

mingled
with
venom
of

as

the
age
will
pour
it
in
shall
never

though
it
do

as

shall
observe
him
with

why
art
thou
not
at

with
him
thomas

he
is
not

he
dines

thou
tell

subject
is
the

soil

he
the

therefore
my
grief
stretches
itself
beyond
the
hour
of

the
blood
weeps
from
my
heart
when
i
do
shape
in
forms
imaginary
the
unguided
days
and
rotten
times
that
you
shall
look
upon
when
i
am
sleeping
with
my
ancestors
for
when
his
headstrong
riot
hath
no
curb
when
rage
and
hot
blood
are
his
counsellors
when
means
and
lavish
manners
meet
together
o
with
what
wings
shall
his
affections
fly
towards
fronting
peril
and
opposed
decay
warwick
my

so
like

the

will
in
the
perfectness
of
time
cast
off
his
followers
and
their

prince
henry
o
pardon
me
my
liege
but
for
my
tears
the
moist
impediments
unto
my
speech
i
had
forestall
d
this
dear
and
deep
rebuke
ere
you
with
grief
had
spoke
and
i
had
heard
the
course
of
it
so
far
there
is
your
crown
and
he
that
wears
the
crown
immortally
long
guard
it
yours
if
i
affect
it
more
than
as
your
honour
and
as
your
renown
let
me
no
more
from
this
obedience
rise
which
my
most
inward
true
and
duteous
spirit
teacheth
this
prostrate
and
exterior
bending
god
witness
with
me
when
i
here
came
in
and
found
no
course
of
breath
within
your
majesty
how
cold
it
struck
my
heart
if
i
do
feign
o
let
me
in
my
present
wildness
die
and
never
live
to
show
the
incredulous
world
the
noble
change
that
i
have
purposed
coming
to
look
on
you
thinking
you
dead
and
dead
almost
my
liege
to
think
you
were
i
spake
unto
this
crown
as
having
sense
and
thus
upbraided
it
the
care
on
thee
depending
hath
fed
upon
the
body
of
my
father
therefore
thou
best
of
gold
art
worst
of
gold
other
less
fine
in
carat
is
more
precious
preserving
life
in
medicine
potable
but
thou
most
fine
most
honour
d
most
renown
d
hast
eat
thy
bearer
up
thus
my
most
royal
liege
accusing
it
i
put
it
on
my
head
to
try
with
it
as
with
an
enemy
that
had
before
my
face
murder
d
my
father
the
quarrel
of
a
true
inheritor
but
if
it
did
infect
my
blood
with
joy
or
swell
my
thoughts
to
any
strain
of
pride
if
any
rebel
or
vain
spirit
of
mine
did
with
the
least
affection
of
a
welcome
give
entertainment
to
the
might
of
it
let
god
for
ever
keep
it
from
my
head
and
make
me
as
the
poorest
vassal
is
that
doth
with
awe
and
terror
kneel
to
it
king
henry
iv
o
my
son
god
put
it
in
thy
mind
to
take
it
hence
that
thou
mightst
win
the
more
thy
father
s
love
pleading
so
wisely
in
excuse
of
it
come
hither
harry
sit
thou
by
my
bed
and
hear
i
think
the
very
latest
counsel
that
ever
i
shall
breathe
god
knows
my
son
by
what
by
paths
and
indirect
crook
d
ways
i
met
this
crown
and
i
myself
know
well
how
troublesome
it
sat
upon
my
head
to
thee
it
shall
descend
with
bitter
quiet
better
opinion
better
confirmation
for
all
the
soil
of
the
achievement
goes
with
me
into
the
earth
it
seem
d
in
me
but
as
an
honour
snatch
d
with
boisterous
hand
and
i
had
many
living
to
upbraid
my
gain
of
it
by
their
assistances
which
daily
grew
to
quarrel
and
to
bloodshed
wounding
supposed
peace
all
these
bold
fears
thou
see
st
with
peril
i
have
answered
for
all
my
reign
hath
been
but
as
a
scene
acting
that
argument
and
now
my
death
changes
the
mode
for
what
in
me
was
purchased
falls
upon
thee
in
a
more
fairer
sort
so
thou
the
garland
wear
st
successively
yet
though
thou
stand
st
more
sure
than
i
could
do
thou
art
not
firm
enough
since
griefs
are
green
and
all
my
friends
which
thou
must
make
thy
friends
have
but
their
stings
and
teeth
newly
ta
en
out
by
whose
fell
working
i
was
first
advanced
and
by
whose
power
i
well
might
lodge
a
fear
to
be
again
displaced
which
to
avoid
i
cut
them
off
and
had
a
purpose
now
to
lead
out
many
to
the
holy
land
lest
rest
and
lying
still
might
make
them
look
too
near
unto
my
state
therefore
my
harry
be
it
thy
course
to
busy
giddy
minds
with
foreign
quarrels
that
action
hence
borne
out
may
waste
the
memory
of
the
former
days
more
would
i
but
my
lungs
are
wasted
so
that
strength
of
speech
is
utterly
denied

knaves

beseech
you

to
countenance
william

of
woncot
against
clement
perkes
of
the
hill
shallow
there
is
many
complaints
davy
against
that
visor
that
visor
is
an
arrant
knave
on
my
knowledge
davy
i
grant
your
worship
that
he
is
a
knave
sir
but
yet
god
forbid
sir
but
a
knave
should
have
some
countenance
at
his
friend
s
request
an
honest
man
sir
is
able
to
speak
for
himself
when
a
knave
is
not
i
have
served
your
worship
truly
sir
this
eight
years
and
if
i
cannot
once
or
twice
in
a
quarter
bear
out
a
knave
against
an
honest
man
i
have
but
a
very
little
credit
with
your
worship
the
knave
is
mine
honest
friend
sir
therefore
i
beseech
your
worship
let
him
be
countenanced
shallow
go
to
i
say
he
shall
have
no
wrong
look
about
davy

where
are
you
sir

off

your

give
me
your
hand
master
bardolph
bardolph
i
am
glad
to
see
your
worship
shallow
i
thank
thee
with
all
my
heart
kind
master
bardolph
and
welcome
my
tall
fellow
to
the
page
come
sir
john
falstaff
i
ll
follow
you
good
master
robert
shallow
exit
shallow
bardolph
look
to
our
horses
exeunt
bardolph
and
page
if
i
were
sawed
into
quantities
i
should
make
four
dozen
of
such
bearded
hermits
staves
as
master
shallow
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
semblable
coherence
of
his
men
s
spirits
and
his
they
by
observing
of
him
do
bear
themselves
like
foolish
justices
he
by
conversing
with
them
is
turned
into
a
justice
like
serving
man
their
spirits
are
so
married
in
conjunction
with
the
participation
of
society
that
they
flock
together
in
consent
like
so
many
wild
geese
if
i
had
a
suit
to
master
shallow
i
would
humour
his
men
with
the
imputation
of
being
near
their
master
if
to
his
men
i
would
curry
with
master
shallow
that
no
man
could
better
command
his
servants
it
is
certain
that
either
wise
bearing
or
ignorant
carriage
is
caught
as
men
take
diseases
one
of
another
therefore
let
men
take
heed
of
their
company
i
will
devise
matter
enough
out
of
this
shallow
to
keep
prince
harry
in
continual
laughter
the
wearing
out
of
six
fashions
which
is
four
terms
or
two
actions
and
a
shall
laugh
without
intervallums
o
it
is
much
that
a
lie
with
a
slight
oath
and
a
jest
with
a
sad
brow
will
do
with
a
fellow
that
never
had
the
ache
in
his
shoulders
o
you
shall
see
him
laugh
till
his
face
be
like
a
wet
cloak
ill
laid
up

the
immediate
heir
of
england
was
this
easy
may
this
be
wash
d
in
lethe
and
forgotten
lord
chief
justice
i
then
did
use
the
person
of
your
father
the
image
of
his
power
lay
then
in
me
and
in
the
administration
of
his
law
whiles
i
was
busy
for
the
commonwealth
your
highness
pleased
to
forget
my
place
the
majesty
and
power
of
law
and
justice
the
image
of
the
king
whom
i
presented
and
struck
me
in
my
very
seat
of
judgment
whereon
as
an
offender
to
your
father
i
gave
bold
way
to
my
authority
and
did
commit
you
if
the
deed
were
ill
be
you
contented
wearing
now
the
garland
to
have
a
son
set
your
decrees
at
nought
to
pluck
down
justice
from
your
awful
bench
to
trip
the
course
of
law
and
blunt
the
sword
that
guards
the
peace
and
safety
of
your
person
nay
more
to
spurn
at
your
most
royal
image
and
mock
your
workings
in
a
second
body
question
your
royal
thoughts
make
the
case
yours
be
now
the
father
and
propose
a
son
hear
your
own
dignity
so
much
profaned
see
your
most
dreadful
laws
so
loosely
slighted
behold
yourself
so
by
a
son
disdain
d
and
then
imagine
me
taking
your
part
and
in
your
power
soft
silencing
your
son
after
this
cold
considerance
sentence
me
and
as
you
are
a
king
speak
in
your
state
what
i
have
done
that
misbecame
my
place
my
person
or
my
liege
s
sovereignty
king
henry
v
you
are
right
justice
and
you
weigh
this
well
therefore
still
bear
the
balance
and
the
sword
and
i
do
wish
your
honours
may
increase
till
you
do
live
to
see
a
son
of
mine
offend
you
and
obey
you
as
i
did
so
shall
i
live
to
speak
my
father
s
words
happy
am
i
that
have
a
man
so
bold
that
dares
do
justice
on
my
proper
son
and
not
less
happy
having
such
a
son
that
would
deliver
up
his
greatness
so
into
the
hands
of
justice
you
did
commit
me
for
which
i
do
commit
into
your
hand
the
unstained
sword
that
you
have
used
to
bear
with
this
remembrance
that
you
use
the
same
with
the
like
bold
just
and
impartial
spirit
as
you
have
done
gainst
me
there
is
my
hand
you
shall
be
as
a
father
to
my
youth
my
voice
shall
sound
as
you
do
prompt
mine
ear

i
will
stoop
and
humble
my
intents
to
your
well
practised
wise
directions

princes
all
believe
me
i
beseech
you
my
father
is
gone
wild
into
his
grave
for
in
his
tomb
lie
my
affections
and
with
his
spirit
sadly
i
survive
to
mock
the
expectation
of
the
world
to
frustrate
prophecies
and
to
raze
out
rotten
opinion
who
hath
writ
me
down

my
seeming

hath
proudly
flow

your

my

my
duty
and
my
speech
to
beg
your
pardons
if
you
look
for
a
good
speech
now
you
undo
me
for
what
i
have
to
say
is
of
mine
own
making
and
what
indeed
i
should
say
will
i
doubt
prove
mine
own
marring
but
to
the
purpose
and
so
to
the
venture
be
it
known
to
you
as
it
is
very
well
i
was
lately
here
in
the
end
of
a
displeasing
play
to
pray
your
patience
for
it
and
to
promise
you
a
better
i
meant
indeed
to
pay
you
with
this
which
if
like
an
ill
venture
it
come
unluckily
home
i
break
and
you
my
gentle
creditors
lose
here
i
promised
you
i
would
be
and
here
i
commit
my
body
to
your
mercies
bate
me
some
and
i
will
pay
you
some
and
as
most
debtors
do
promise
you
infinitely
if
my
tongue
cannot
entreat
you
to
acquit
me
will
you
command
me
to
use
my
legs
and
yet
that
were
but
light
payment
to
dance
out
of
your
debt
but
a
good
conscience
will
make
any
possible
satisfaction
and
so
would
i
all
the
gentlewomen
here
have
forgiven
me
if
the
gentlemen
will
not
then
the
gentlemen
do
not
agree
with
the
gentlewomen
which
was
never
seen
before
in
such
an
assembly
one
word
more
i
beseech
you
if
you
be
not
too
much
cloyed
with
fat
meat
our
humble
author
will
continue
the
story
with
sir
john
in
it
and
make
you
merry
with
fair
katharine
of
france
where
for
any
thing
i
know
falstaff
shall
die
of
a
sweat
unless
already
a
be
killed
with
your
hard
opinions
for
oldcastle
died
a
martyr
and
this
is
not
the
man
my
tongue
is
weary
when
my
legs
are
too
i
will
bid
you
good
night
and
so
kneel
down
before
you
but
indeed
to
pray
for
the
queen
