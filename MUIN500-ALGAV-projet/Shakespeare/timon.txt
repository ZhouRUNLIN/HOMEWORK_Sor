tis
this
comes
off
well
and
excellent
painter
indifferent
poet
admirable
how
this
grace
speaks
his
own
standing
what
a
mental
power
this
eye
shoots
forth
how
big
imagination
moves
in
this
lip
to
the
dumbness
of
the
gesture
one
might
interpret
painter
it
is
a
pretty
mocking
of
the
life
here
is
a
touch
is
t
good
poet
i
will
say
of

happy
man
painter
look
more

this
confluence
this
great
flood
of

rough
work
shaped
out
a
man
whom
this
beneath

doth
embrace
and
hug
with
amplest
entertainment
my
free
drift
halts
not
particularly
but
moves
itself
in
a
wide
sea
of
wax
no
levell
d
malice
infects
one
comma
in
the
course
i
hold
but
flies
an
eagle
flight
bold
and
forth
on
leaving
no
tract
behind
painter
how
shall
i
understand
you
poet
i
will
unbolt
to
you
you
see
how
all
conditions
how
all

austere
quality
tender
down
their

gracious
nature
hanging
subdues
and
properties
to
his

the

is
the
readiest
man
to

t
has
been
proved
if
i
were

fear
to

that
then
thou

might

have
that
happiness
my

that
you
would
once
use
our

whereby
we
might
express
some
part
of

zeals
we
should
think
ourselves
for
ever
perfect
timon
o
no
doubt
my
good
friends
but
the
gods
themselves
have
provided
that
i
shall
have
much
help
from
you
how
had
you
been
my

else
why
have
you
that
charitable
title
from
thousands
did
not
you
chiefly
belong
to
my
heart
i
have
told
more
of
you
to
myself
than
you
can
with
modesty
speak
in
your
own
behalf
and
thus
far
i
confirm
you
o
you
gods
think
i
what
need
we
have
any
friends
if
we
should
ne
er
have
need
of
em
they
were
the
most
needless
creatures
living
should
we
ne
er
have
use
for
em
and
would
most
resemble
sweet
instruments
hung
up
in
cases
that
keep
their
sounds
to
themselves
why
i
have
often
wished
myself
poorer
that
i
might
come
nearer
to
you
we
are
born
to
do
benefits
and
what
better
or
properer
can
we
can
our
own
than
the

a
precious

tis
to

one
of
his

was
with
the
lord
lucullus
to

what
necessity
belonged
to

second
stranger
i
tell
you
denied
my

what
a
strange
case
was
that
now
before

was
very
little
honour
showed

i
must
needs
confess
i
have
received
some
small
kindnesses
from
him
as
money
plate
jewels
and
such
like
trifles
nothing
comparing
to
his
yet

servilius

true
sir

what
a
wicked
beast
was
i
to
disfurnish
myself
against
such
a
good
time
when
i
might
ha
shown
myself
honourable
how
unluckily
it
happened
that
i
should
purchase
the
day
before
for
a
little
part
and
undo
a
great
deal
of
honoured
servilius
now
before
the
gods
i
am
not
able
to
do
the
more
beast
i
say
i
was
sending
to
use
lord
timon
myself
these
gentlemen
can
witness
but
i
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
athens
i
had
done
t
now
commend
me
bountifully
to
his
good
lordship
and
i
hope
his
honour
will
conceive
the
fairest
of
me
because
i
have
no
power
to
be
kind
and
tell
him
this
from
me
i
count
it
one
of
my
greatest
afflictions
say
that
i
cannot
pleasure
such
an
honourable
gentleman

you
befriend

far
as
to
use
mine
own
words

you
observe

stranger
why
this

just
of
the

piece
is
every
flatterer

spirit
who
can
call
him
his
friend
that
dips
in
the

dish
for
in
my
knowing
timon
has
been
this
lord
s
father
and
kept
his
credit
with
his

supported
his
estate
nay
timon

has
paid
his
men
their
wages
he
ne

but
timon
s
silver
treads
upon
his
lip
and
yet
o
see
the
monstrousness
of
man
when
he
looks
out
in
an
ungrateful
shape
he
does
deny
him
in
respect
of
his
what
charitable
men
afford
to
beggars

in

the

to
bring

set
quarrelling
upon
the
head

indeed
is
valour
misbegot

came
into

you
cannot
make

to
bear

lords
then
under

not
endure

quietly
cut
their

a

has
a
sin
that

drowns
him
and
takes
his
valour
prisoner
if
there
were
no
foes
that
were
enough
to
overcome
him

beastly
fury
he
has
been

what
s
to

so
full
of

it

this

nothing

we
tender
our

the
