act
i
prologue
enter
chorus
chorus
o
for
a
muse
of
fire
that
would
ascend
the
brightest
heaven
of
invention
a
kingdom
for
a
stage
princes
to
act
and
monarchs
to
behold
the
swelling
scene
then
should
the
warlike
harry
like
himself
assume
the
port
of
mars

at
his

leash
d
in
like

should
famine
sword

crouch
for

but
pardon
and
gentles
all
the
flat
unraised
spirits
that
have
dared
on
this
unworthy
scaffold
to
bring
forth
so
great
an
object
can
this
cockpit
hold
the
vasty
fields
of
france
or
may
we
cram
within
this
wooden
o
the
very
casques
that
did
affright
the
air
at
agincourt
o
pardon
since
a
crooked
figure
may
attest
in
little
place
a
million
and
let
us
ciphers
to
this
great
accompt
on
your
imaginary
forces
work
suppose
within
the
girdle
of
these
walls
are
now
confined
two
mighty
monarchies
whose
high
upreared
and
abutting
fronts
the
perilous
narrow
ocean
parts
asunder
piece
out
our
imperfections
with
your
thoughts
into
a
thousand
parts
divide
on
man
and
make
imaginary
puissance
think
when
we
talk
of
horses
that
you
see
them
printing
their
proud
hoofs
i
the
receiving
earth
for
tis
your
thoughts
that
now
must
deck
our
kings
carry
them
here
and
there
jumping
o

times
turning
the
accomplishment
of
many
years
into
an
hour

for
the
which
supply
admit

to
this
history

like
your
humble
patience
pray
gently
to
hear
kindly
to
judge
our
play
exit
scene
i
london
an
ante
chamber
in
the
king
s
palace
enter
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
bishop
of
ely
canterbury
my
lord
i
ll
tell
you
that
self
bill
is
urged
which
in
the
eleventh
year
of
the
last
king
s
reign
was
like
and
had
indeed
against
us
pass
d
but
that
the
scambling
and
unquiet
time
did
push
it
out
of
farther
question
ely
but
how
my
lord
shall
we
resist
it
now
canterbury
it
must
be
thought
on
if
it
pass
against
us
we
lose
the
better
half
of
our
possession
for
all
the
temporal
lands
which
men
devout
by
testament
have
given
to
the
church
would
they
strip
from
us
being
valued
thus
as
much
as
would
maintain
to
the
king
s
honour
full
fifteen
earls
and
fifteen
hundred
knights
six
thousand
and
two
hundred
good
esquires
and
to
relief
of
lazars
and
weak
age
of
indigent
faint
souls
past
corporal
toil
a
hundred
almshouses
right
well
supplied
and
to
the
coffers
of
the
king
beside
a
thousand
pounds
by
the
year
thus
runs
the
bill
ely
this
would
drink
deep
canterbury
twould
drink
the
cup
and
all
ely
but
what
prevention
canterbury
the
king
is
full
of
grace
and
fair
regard
ely
and
a
true
lover
of
the
holy
church
canterbury
the
courses
of
his
youth
promised
it
not
the
breath
no
sooner
left
his
father
s
body
but
that
his
wildness
mortified
in
him
seem
d
to
die
too
yea
at
that
very
moment
consideration
like
an
angel
came
and
whipp
d
the
offending
adam
out
of
him
leaving
his
body
as
a
paradise
to
envelop
and
contain
celestial
spirits
never
was
such
a
sudden
scholar
made
never
came
reformation
in
a
flood
with
such
a
heady
currance
scouring
faults
nor
never
hydra
headed
wilfulness
so
soon
did
lose
his
seat
and
all
at
once
as
in
this
king
ely
we
are
blessed
in
the
change
canterbury
hear
him
but
reason
in
divinity
and
all
admiring
with
an
inward
wish
you
would
desire
the
king
were
made
a
prelate
hear
him
debate
of
commonwealth
affairs
you
would
say
it
hath
been
all
in
all
his
study
list
his
discourse
of
war
and
you
shall
hear
a
fearful
battle
render
d
you
in
music
turn
him
to
any
cause
of
policy
the
gordian
knot
of
it
he
will
unloose
familiar
as
his
garter
that
when
he
speaks
the
air
a
charter
d
libertine
is
still
and
the
mute
wonder
lurketh
in
men
s
ears
to
steal
his
sweet
and
honey
d
sentences
so
that
the
art
and
practic
part
of
life
must
be
the
mistress
to
this
theoric
which
is
a
wonder
how
his
grace
should
glean
it
since
his
addiction
was
to
courses
vain
his
companies
unletter
d
rude
and
shallow
his
hours
fill
d
up
with
riots
banquets
sports
and
never
noted
in
him
any
study
any
retirement
any
sequestration
from
open
haunts
and
popularity
ely
the
strawberry
grows
underneath
the
nettle
and
wholesome
berries
thrive
and
ripen
best
neighbour
d
by
fruit
of
baser
quality
and
so
the
prince
obscured
his
contemplation
under
the
veil
of
wildness
which
no
doubt
grew
like
the
summer
grass
fastest
by
night
unseen
yet
crescive
in
his
faculty
canterbury
it
must
be
so
for
miracles
are
ceased
and
therefore
we
must
needs
admit
the
means
how
things
are
perfected
ely
but
my
good
lord
how
now
for
mitigation
of
this
bill
urged
by
the
commons
doth
his
majesty
incline
to
it
or
no
canterbury
he
seems
indifferent
or
rather
swaying
more
upon
our
part
than
cherishing
the
exhibiters
against
us
for
i
have
made
an
offer
to
his
majesty
upon
our
spiritual
convocation
and
in
regard
of
causes
now
in
hand
which
i
have
open
d
to
his
grace
at
large
as
touching
france
to
give
a
greater
sum
than
ever
at
one
time
the
clergy
yet
did
to
his
predecessors
part
withal
ely
how
did
this
offer
seem
received
my
lord
canterbury
with
good
acceptance
of
his
majesty
save
that
there
was
not
time
enough
to
hear
as
i
perceived
his
grace
would
fain
have
done
the
severals
and
unhidden
passages
of
his
true
titles
to
some
certain
dukedoms
and
generally
to
the
crown
and
seat
of
france
derived
from
edward
his
great
grandfather
ely
what
was
the
impediment
that
broke
this
off
canterbury
the
french
ambassador
upon
that
instant
craved
audience
and
the
hour
i
think
is
come
to
give
him
hearing
is
it
four
o
clock
ely
it
is
canterbury
then
go
we
in
to
know
his
embassy
which
i
could
with
a
ready
guess
declare
before
the
frenchman
speak
a
word
of
it
ely
i
ll
wait
upon
you
and
i
long
to
hear
it

we

we
would
be
resolved
before
we
hear
him
of
some
things
of
weight

task

thoughts
concerning
us
and
france
enter
the
archbishop
of

canterbury
god
and
his
angels
guard
your
sacred
throne
and
make
you
long
become
it
king
henry
v
sure
we
thank
you
my
learned
lord
we
pray
you
to
proceed
and
justly
and
religiously
unfold
why
the
law
salique
that
they
have
in
france
or
should
or
should
not
bar
us
in
our
claim
and
god
forbid
my
dear
and
faithful
lord
that
you
should
fashion
wrest
or
bow
your
reading
or
nicely
charge
your
understanding
soul
with
opening
titles
miscreate
whose
right
suits
not
in
native
colours
with
the
truth
for
god
doth
know
how
many
now
in
health
shall
drop
their
blood
in
approbation
of
what
your
reverence
shall
incite
us
to
therefore
take
heed
how
you
impawn
our
person
how
you
awake
our
sleeping
sword
of
war
we
charge
you
in
the
name
of
god
take
heed
for
never
two
such
kingdoms
did
contend
without
much
fall
of
blood
whose
guiltless
drops
are
every
one
a
woe
a
sore
complaint
gainst
him
whose
wrong
gives
edge
unto
the
swords
that
make
such
waste
in
brief
mortality
under
this
conjuration
speak
my
lord
for
we
will
hear
note
and
believe
in
heart
that
what
you
speak
is
in
your
conscience
wash
d
as
pure
as
sin
with
baptism
canterbury
then
hear
me
gracious
sovereign
and
you
peers
that
owe
yourselves
your
lives
and
services
to
this
imperial
throne
there
is
no
bar
to
make
against
your
highness
claim
to
france
but
this
which
they
produce
from
pharamond
in
terram
salicam
mulieres
ne
succedant
no
woman
shall
succeed
in
salique
land
which
salique
land
the
french
unjustly
gloze
to
be
the
realm
of
france
and
pharamond
the
founder
of
this
law
and
female
bar
yet
their
own
authors
faithfully
affirm
that
the
land
salique
is
in
germany
between
the
floods
of
sala
and
of
elbe
where
charles
the
great
having
subdued
the
saxons
there
left
behind
and
settled
certain
french
who
holding
in
disdain
the
german
women
for
some
dishonest
manners
of
their
life
establish
d
then
this
law
to
wit
no
female
should
be
inheritrix
in
salique
land
which
salique
as
i
said
twixt
elbe
and
sala
is
at
this
day
in
germany
call
d
meisen
then
doth
it
well
appear
that
salique
law
was
not
devised
for
the
realm
of
france
nor
did
the
french
possess
the
salique
land
until
four
hundred
one
and
twenty
years
after
defunction
of
king
pharamond
idly
supposed
the
founder
of
this
law
who
died
within
the
year
of
our
redemption
four
hundred
twenty
six
and
charles
the
great
subdued
the
saxons
and
did
seat
the
french
beyond
the
river
sala
in
the
year
eight
hundred
five
besides
their
writers
say
king
pepin
which
deposed
childeric
did
as
heir
general
being
descended
of
blithild
which
was
daughter
to
king
clothair
make
claim
and
title
to
the
crown
of
france
hugh
capet
also
who
usurped
the
crown
of
charles
the
duke
of
lorraine
sole
heir
male
of
the
true
line
and
stock
of
charles
the
great
to
find
his
title
with
some
shows
of
truth
through
in
pure
truth
it
was
corrupt
and
naught
convey
d
himself
as
heir
to
the
lady
lingare
daughter
to
charlemain
who
was
the
son
to
lewis
the
emperor
and
lewis
the
son
of
charles
the
great
also
king
lewis
the
tenth
who
was
sole
heir
to
the
usurper
capet
could
not
keep
quiet
in
his
conscience
wearing
the
crown
of
france
till
satisfied
that
fair
queen
isabel
his
grandmother
was
lineal
of
the
lady
ermengare
daughter
to
charles
the
foresaid
duke
of
lorraine
by
the
which
marriage
the
line
of
charles
the
great
was
re
united
to
the
crown
of
france
so
that
as
clear
as
is
the
summer
s
sun
king
pepin
s
title
and
hugh
capet
s
claim
king
lewis
his
satisfaction
all
appear
to
hold
in
right
and
title
of
the
female
so
do
the
kings
of
france
unto
this
day
howbeit
they
would
hold
up
this
salique
law
to
bar
your
highness
claiming
from
the
female
and
rather
choose
to
hide
them
in
a
net
than
amply
to
imbar
their
crooked
titles
usurp
d
from
you
and
your
progenitors
king
henry
v
may
i
with
right
and
conscience
make
this
claim
canterbury
the
sin
upon
my
head
dread
sovereign
for
in
the
book
of
numbers
is
it
writ
when
the
man

my
dread
lord
to
your
great
grandsire

whom
you
claim

his
warlike
spirit
and
your
great
uncle

edward
the
black
prince
who
on
the
french
ground
play
d
a
tragedy
making
defeat
on
the
full
power
of
france
whiles
his
most
mighty
father
on
a
hill
stood
smiling
to
behold
his
lion
s
whelp
forage
in
blood
of
french
nobility
o
noble
english
that
could
entertain
with
half
their
forces
the
full
pride
of
france
and
let
another
half
stand
laughing
by
all
out
of
work
and
cold
for

awake

valiant
dead

with
your
puissant

thrice
puissant
liege

very
may
morn
of
his
youth
ripe
for
exploits
and
mighty
enterprises
exeter
your
brother
kings
and
monarchs
of
the
earth
do
all
expect
that
you
should
rouse
yourself
as
did
the
former
lions
of
your
blood
westmoreland
they
know
your
grace
hath
cause
and
means
and
might
so
hath
your
highness
never
king
of
england
had
nobles
richer
and
more
loyal
subjects
whose
hearts
have
left
their
bodies
here
in
england
and
lie
pavilion

in

fields

o
let
their
bodies
follow
my
dear
liege
with
blood
and
sword
and
fire
to
win
your
right
in
aid
whereof
we
of
the
spiritualty
will
raise
your
highness
such
a
mighty
sum
as
never
did
the
clergy
at
one
time
bring
in
to
any
of
your
ancestors
king
henry
v
we
must
not
only
arm
to
invade
the
french
but
lay
down
our
proportions
to
defend
against
the
scot
who
will
make
road
upon
us
with
all
advantages
canterbury
they
of
those
marches
gracious
sovereign
shall
be
a
wall
sufficient
to
defend
our
inland
from
the
pilfering
borderers
king
henry
v
we
do
not
mean
the
coursing
snatchers
only
but
fear
the
main
intendment
of
the
scot
who
hath
been
still
a
giddy
neighbour
to
us
for
you
shall
read
that
my
great
grandfather
never
went
with
his
forces
into
france
but
that
the
scot
on
his
unfurnish
d
kingdom
came
pouring
like
the
tide
into
a
breach
with
ample
and
brim
fulness
of
his
force
galling
the
gleaned
land
with
hot
assays
girding
with
grievous
siege
castles
and
towns
that
england
being
empty
of
defence
hath
shook
and
trembled
at
the
ill
neighbourhood
canterbury
she
hath
been
then
more
fear
d
than
harm
d
my
liege
for
hear
her
but
exampled
by
herself
when
all
her
chivalry
hath
been
in
france
and
she
a
mourning
widow
of
her
nobles
she
hath
herself
not
only
well
defended
but
taken
and
impounded
as
a
stray
the
king
of
scots
whom
she
did
send
to
france
to
fill
king
edward
s
fame
with
prisoner
kings
and
make
her
chronicle
as
rich
with
praise
as
is
the
ooze
and
bottom
of
the
sea
with
sunken
wreck
and
sunless
treasuries
westmoreland
but
there
s
a
saying
very
old
and
true
if
that
you
will
france
win
then
with
scotland
first
begin
for
once
the
eagle
england
being
in
prey
to
her
unguarded
nest
the
weasel
scot
comes
sneaking
and
so
sucks
her
princely
eggs
playing
the
mouse
in
absence
of
the
cat
to
tear
and
havoc
more
than
she
can
eat
exeter
it
follows
then
the
cat
must
stay
at
home
yet
that
is
but
a
crush
d
necessity
since
we
have
locks
to
safeguard
necessaries
and
pretty
traps
to
catch
the
petty
thieves
while
that
the
armed
hand
doth
fight
abroad
the
advised
head
defends
itself
at
home
for
government
though
high
and
low
and
lower
put
into
parts
doth
keep
in
one
consent
congreeing
in
a
full
and
natural
close
like
music
canterbury
therefore
doth
heaven
divide
the
state
of
man
in
divers
functions
setting
endeavour
in
continual
motion
to
which
is
fixed
as
an
aim
or
butt
obedience
for
so
work
the
honey
bees
creatures
that
by
a
rule
in
nature
teach
the
act
of
order
to
a
peopled
kingdom
they
have
a
king
and
officers
of
sorts
where
some
like
magistrates
correct
at
home
others
like
merchants
venture
trade
abroad
others
like
soldiers
armed
in
their
stings
make
boot
upon
the
summer
s
velvet
buds
which
pillage
they
with
merry
march
bring
home
to
the
tent
royal
of
their
emperor
who
busied
in
his
majesty
surveys
the
singing
masons
building
roofs
of
gold
the
civil
citizens
kneading
up
the
honey
the
poor
mechanic
porters
crowding
in

pleasure
of

for
we
hear
your
greeting
is
from
him
not
from
the
king
first
ambassador
may
t
please
your
majesty
to
give
us
leave
freely
to
render
what
we
have
in
charge
or
shall
we
sparingly
show
you
far
off
the
dauphin
s
meaning
and
our
embassy
king
henry
v
we
are
no
tyrant
but
a
christian
king
unto
whose
grace
our
passion
is
as
subject
as
are
our
wretches
fetter
d
in
our
prisons
therefore
with
frank
and
with
uncurbed
plainness
tell
us
the
dauphin
s
mind
first
ambassador
thus
then
in
few
your
highness
lately
sending
into
france
did
claim
some
certain
dukedoms
in
the
right
of
your
great
predecessor
king
edward
the
third
in
answer
of
which
claim
the
prince
our
master
says
that
you
savour
too
much
of
your
youth
and
bids
you
be
advised
there
s
nought
in
france
that
can
be
with
a
nimble
galliard
won
you
cannot
revel
into
dukedoms
there
he
therefore
sends
you
meeter
for
your
spirit
this
tun
of
treasure
and
in
lieu
of
this
desires
you
let
the
dukedoms
that
you
claim
hear
no
more
of
you
this
the
dauphin
speaks
king
henry
v
what
treasure
uncle
exeter
tennis
balls
my
liege
king
henry
v
we
are
glad
the
dauphin
is
so
pleasant
with
us
his
present
and
your
pains
we
thank
you
for
when
we
have
march
d
our
rackets
to
these
balls
we
will
in
france
by
god
s
grace
play
a
set
shall
strike
his
father
s
crown
into
the
hazard
tell
him
he
hath
made
a
match
with
such
a
wrangler
that
all
the
courts
of
france
will
be
disturb
d
with
chaces
and
we
understand
him
well
how
he
comes
o
er
us
with
our
wilder
days
not
measuring
what
use
we
made
of
them
we
never
valued
this
poor
seat
of
england
and
therefore
living
hence
did
give
ourself
to
barbarous
licence
as
tis
ever
common
that
men
are
merriest
when
they
are
from
home
but
tell
the
dauphin
i
will
keep
my
state
be
like
a
king
and
show
my
sail
of
greatness
when
i
do
rouse
me
in
my
throne
of
france
for
that
i
have
laid
by
my
majesty
and
plodded
like
a
man
for
working
days
but
i
will
rise
there
with
so
full
a
glory
that
i
will
dazzle
all
the
eyes
of
france
yea
strike
the
dauphin
blind
to
look
on
us
and
tell
the
pleasant
prince
this
mock
of
his
hath
turn
d
his
balls
to
gun
stones
and
his
soul
shall
stand
sore
charged
for
the
wasteful
vengeance
that
shall
fly
with
them
for
many
a
thousand
widows
shall
this
his
mock
mock
out
of
their
dear
husbands
mock
mothers
from
their
sons
mock
castles
down
and
some
are
yet
ungotten
and
unborn
that
shall
have
cause
to
curse
the
dauphin
s
scorn
but
this
lies
all
within
the
will
of
god
to
whom
i
do
appeal
and
in
whose
name
tell
you
the
dauphin
i
am
coming
on
to
venge
me
as
i
may
and
to
put
forth
my
rightful
hand
in
a
well
hallow
d
cause
so
get
you
hence
in
peace
and
tell
the
dauphin
his
jest
will
savour
but
of
shallow
wit
when
thousands
weep
more
than
did
laugh
at
it
convey
them
with
safe
conduct

you
well
exeunt

this
was
a
merry

to
make
the

blush
at
it
therefore
my
lords
omit
no
happy
hour
that
may
give
furtherance
to
our
expedition
for
we
have
now
no
thought
in
us
but
france
save
those
to
god
that
run
before
our
business
therefore
let
our
proportions
for
these
wars
be
soon
collected
and
all
things
thought
upon
that
may
with
reasonable
swiftness
add
more
feathers
to
our
wings
for

before
we
ll
chide
this
dauphin
at

appeal
king

v
the
mercy
that
was
quick
in

late
by
your

counsel
is
suppress

and
kill
d
you
must
not
dare
for
shame
to
talk
of
mercy
for
your
own
reasons
turn
into
your
bosoms
as
dogs
upon
their
masters
worrying
you
see
you
my
princes
and
my
noble
peers
these
english
monsters
my
lord
of
cambridge
here
you
know
how
apt
our
love
was
to
accord
to
furnish
him
with
all
appertinents
belonging
to
his
honour
and
this
man
hath
for
a
few
light
crowns
lightly
conspired
and
sworn
unto
the
practises
of
france
to
kill
us
here
in
hampton
to
the
which
this
knight
no
less
for
bounty
bound
to
us
than
cambridge
is
hath
likewise
sworn
but
o
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
lord
scroop
thou
cruel
ingrateful
savage
and
inhuman
creature
thou
that
didst
bear
the
key
of
all
my
counsels
that
knew
st
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
that
almost
mightst
have
coin
d
me
into
gold
wouldst
thou
have
practised
on
me
for
thy
use
may
it
be
possible
that
foreign
hire
could
out
of
thee
extract
one
spark
of
evil
that
might
annoy
my
finger
tis
so
strange
that
though
the
truth
of
it
stands
off
as
gross
as
black
and
white
my
eye
will
scarcely
see
it
treason
and
murder
ever
kept
together
as
two
yoke
devils
sworn
to
either
s
purpose
working
so
grossly
in
a
natural
cause
that
admiration
did
not
whoop
at
them
but
thou
gainst
all
proportion
didst
bring
in
wonder
to
wait
on
treason
and
on
murder
and
whatsoever
cunning
fiend
it
was
that
wrought
upon
thee
so
preposterously
hath
got
the
voice
in
hell
for
excellence
all
other
devils
that
suggest
by
treasons
do
botch
and
bungle
up
damnation
with
patches
colours
and
with
forms
being
fetch
d
from
glistering
semblances
of
piety
but
he
that
temper
d
thee
bade
thee
stand
up
gave
thee
no
instance
why
thou
shouldst
do
treason
unless
to
dub
thee
with
the
name
of
traitor
if
that
same
demon
that
hath
gull
d
thee
thus
should
with
his
lion
gait
walk
the
whole
world
he
might
return
to
vasty
tartar
back
and
tell
the
legions
i
can
never
win
a
soul
so
easy
as
that
englishman

how

thou
with
jealousy
infected

sweetness
of

it
us
concerns

that

i

us
do

heard
their
embassy
how
well
supplied
with
noble
counsellors
how
modest
in
exception

withal
how
terrible
in
constant
resolution
and
you
shall
find
his
vanities
forespent
were
but
the
outside
of
the
roman
brutus
covering

tis
not
so
my

though
we

it
so
it
is
no

in

tis
best
to
weigh
the

more

the

am
boy
to
them
all
three
but
all
they
three
though
they
would
serve
me
could
not
be
man
to
me
for
indeed
three
such
antics
do
not
amount
to
a
man
for
bardolph
he
is
white
livered
and
red
faced
by
the
means
whereof
a
faces
it
out
but
fights
not
for
pistol
he
hath
a
killing
tongue
and
a
quiet
sword
by
the
means
whereof
a
breaks
words
and
keeps
whole
weapons
for
nym
he
hath
heard
that
men
of
few
words
are
the
best
men
and
therefore
he
scorns
to
say
his
prayers
lest
a
should
be
thought
a
coward
but
his
few
bad
words
are
matched
with
as
few
good
deeds
for
a
never
broke
any
man
s
head
but
his
own
and
that
was
against
a
post
when
he
was
drunk
they
will
steal
any
thing
and
call
it
purchase
bardolph
stole
a
lute
case
bore
it
twelve
leagues
and
sold
it
for
three
half
pence
nym
and
bardolph
are
sworn
brothers
in
filching
and
in
calais
they
stole
a
fire
shovel
i
knew
by
that
piece
of
service
the
men
would
carry
coals
they
would
have
me
as
familiar
with
men
s
pockets
as
their
gloves
or
their
handkerchers
which
makes
much
against
my
manhood
if
i
should
take
from
another
s
pocket
to
put
into
mine
for
it
is
plain
pocketing
up
of
wrongs
i
must
leave
them
and
seek
some
better
service
their
villany
goes
against
my
weak
stomach
and
therefore
i
must
cast
it
up
exit
re
enter
fluellen
gower
following
gower
captain
fluellen
you
must
come
presently
to
the
mines
the
duke
of
gloucester
would
speak
with
you
fluellen
to
the
mines
tell
you
the
duke

is
not
so
good
to
come
to
the

not
according
to
the

upon
my
particular
knowledge
of
his
directions
by

he
will
maintain
his
argument
as
well
as
any

disciplines
of

pristine

of

iii
the

v
how
yet
resolves
the

of

this
is
the
latest
parle
we
will
admit
therefore
to
our
best
mercy
give
yourselves
or
like
to
men
proud
of
destruction
defy
us
to
our
worst
for
as
i
am
a
soldier
a
name
that
in
my
thoughts
becomes
me
best
if
i
begin
the
battery
once
again
i
will
not
leave
the
half
achieved
harfleur
till
in
her
ashes
she
lie
buried
the
gates
of
mercy
shall
be
all
shut
up
and
the
flesh
d
soldier
rough
and
hard
of
heart
in
liberty
of
bloody
hand
shall
range
with
conscience
wide
as
hell
mowing
like

your
fresh
fair
virgins
and
your
flowering
infants
what
is
it
then
to

do
with
his
smirch
d
complexion
all
fell
feats
enlink
d
to
waste
and
desolation
what
is
t
to
me
when
you
yourselves
are
cause
if
your
pure
maidens
fall
into
the
hand
of
hot
and
forcing
violation
what
rein
can
hold
licentious
wickedness
when
down
the
hill
he
holds
his
fierce
career
we
may
as
bootless
spend
our
vain
command
upon
the
enraged
soldiers
in
their
spoil
as
send
precepts
to
the
leviathan
to
come
ashore
therefore
you
men
of
harfleur
take
pity
of
your
town
and
of
your
people
whiles
yet
my

are
in
my
command
whiles

the
filthy

contagious
clouds
of
heady
murder

and
villany
if
not
why
in
a
moment
look
to
see
the
blind
and
bloody
soldier
with
foul
hand
defile
the
locks
of
your
shrill
shrieking
daughters
your
fathers
taken
by
the
silver
beards
and
their
most
reverend
heads
dash
d
to
the
walls
your
naked
infants
spitted
upon
pikes
whiles
the
mad
mothers
with
their
howls
confused
do
break
the
clouds
as
did
the
wives
of
jewry
at
herod
s
bloody
hunting
slaughtermen
what
say
you
will
you
yield
and
this
avoid
or
guilty

thus
destroy
d
governor
our
expectation
hath
this
day
an

the
dauphin
whom
of
succors
we
entreated
returns
us
that
his
powers
are

not
ready
to

so
great
a

therefore

we
yield
our

to

but
keeps
the

most
valiantly
with
excellent
discipline
there
is
an
aunchient
lieutenant
there
at
the
pridge
i
think
in
my
very
conscience
he
is
as
valiant
a
man
as
mark
antony
and
he
is
a
man
of
no
estimation
in
the

what

that
goddess
blind
that
stands
upon
the
rolling
restless

fluellen
by
your
patience
aunchient
pistol
fortune
is
painted
blind
with
a
muffler
afore
her
eyes
to
signify
to
you
that
fortune
is
blind
and
she
is
painted
also
with
a
wheel
to
signify
to
you
which
is
the
moral
of
it
that
she
is
turning
and
inconstant
and
mutability
and
variation
and
her

look

is
fixed
upon
a
spherical

which
rolls

in
good

the

makes
a
most
excellent
description
of
it

is
an
excellent
moral
pistol
fortune

on
him
for

exeter
hath
given
the
doom
of
death
for

of
little
price
therefore
go
speak
the
duke
will
hear
thy
voice
and
let
not
bardolph
s
vital
thread
be
cut
with
edge
of
penny

vile
reproach
speak

for
his
life

i
will
thee
requite
fluellen

fluellen
certainly
aunchient
it
is
not
a

to
rejoice
at
for
if
look
you
he
were
my
brother
i
would
desire
the
duke
to
use
his

a

fluellen
i
ll
assure
you
a
uttered
as
brave
words
at
the
bridge
as
you
shall
see
in
a
summer
s
day
but
it
is
very
well
what
he
has
spoke
to
me
that
is
well
i
warrant
you
when
time
is
serve
gower
why
tis
a
gull
a
fool
a
rogue
that
now
and
then
goes
to
the
wars
to
grace
himself
at
his
return
into
london
under
the
form
of
a
soldier
and
such
fellows
are
perfect
in
the
great
commanders
names
and
they
will
learn
you
by
rote
where
services
were
done
at
such
and
such
a
sconce
at
such
a
breach
at
such
a
convoy
who
came
off
bravely
who
was
shot
who
disgraced
what
terms
the
enemy
stood
on
and
this
they
con
perfectly
in
the
phrase
of
war
which
they
trick
up
with
new
tuned
oaths
and
what
a
beard
of
the
general
s
cut
and
a
horrid
suit
of
the
camp
will
do
among
foaming
bottles
and
ale
washed
wits
is
wonderful
to
be
thought
on
but
you
must
learn
to
know
such
slanders
of
the
age
or
else
you
may
be
marvellously
mistook
fluellen
i
tell
you
what
captain

i
do
perceive
he
is
not
the
man
that
he
would
gladly
make
show
to
the
world
he
is
if
i
find
a
hole
in

paid

none
of

better

than

tell

we
could
have
rebuked
him
at
harfleur
but
that
we
thought
not
good
to
bruise
an
injury
till
it
were
full
ripe
now
we
speak
upon
our
cue
and
our
voice
is
imperial
england
shall
repent
his
folly
see
his
weakness
and
admire
our

bid
him
therefore
consider
of
his
ransom
which
must
proportion
the
losses
we
have
borne
the
subjects
we
have
lost
the
disgrace
we
have
digested
which
in
weight
to
re
answer
his
pettiness
would
bow
under
for
our
losses
his
exchequer
is
too
poor
for
the
effusion
of
our
blood
the
muster
of
his
kingdom
too
faint
a
number
and
for
our
disgrace
his
own
person
kneeling
at
our
feet
but
a
weak
and
worthless
satisfaction
to
this
add
defiance
and
tell
him
for
conclusion
he
hath
betrayed
his
followers
whose
condemnation
is
pronounced
so
far
my

thou
dost
thy

fairly
turn
thee
back

tell
thy

i
do
not
seek
him
now
but
could
be
willing
to
march
on
to
calais
without
impeachment
for
to
say
the
sooth
though
tis
no
wisdom
to
confess
so
much
unto
an
enemy
of
craft
and
vantage
my
people
are
with
sickness
much
enfeebled
my
numbers
lessened
and
those
few
i
have
almost
no
better
than
so
many
french
who
when
they
were
in
health
i
tell
thee
herald
i
thought
upon
one
pair
of
english
legs
did
march
three
frenchmen
yet
forgive
me
god
that
i
do
brag
thus
this
your
air
of
france
hath
blown
that
vice
in
me
i
must
repent
go
therefore
tell
thy
master
here
i
am
my
ransom
is
this
frail
and
worthless
trunk
my
army
but
a
weak
and
sickly
guard
yet
god
before
tell
him
we
will
come
on
though
france
himself
and
such
another
neighbour
stand
in
our
way
there
s
for
thy
labour
montjoy
go
bid
thy
master
well
advise
himself
if
we
may
pass
we
will
if
we
be
hinder
d
we
shall
your
tawny
ground
with
your
red
blood
discolour
and
so
montjoy
fare
you
well
the
sum
of
all
our
answer
is
but
this
we
would
not
seek
a
battle
as
we
are
nor
as
we
are
we
say
we
will
not
shun
it

the
best

excellent
armour
but
let
my
horse
have
his
due
constable
it
is
the
best
horse
of
europe
orleans
will
it
never
be
morning
dauphin
my
lord
of
orleans
and
my
lord
high
constable
you
talk
of
horse
and
armour
orleans
you
are
as
well
provided
of
both
as
any
prince
in
the
world
dauphin
what
a
long
night
is
this
i
will
not
change
my
horse
with
any
that
treads
but
on
four
pasterns
ca
ha
he
bounds
from
the
earth
as
if
his
entrails
were
hairs
le
cheval
volant
the
pegasus
chez
les

de
feu
when
i
bestride
him
i
soar
i
am
a
hawk
he
trots
the
air
the
earth
sings
when
he
touches
it
the
basest
horn
of
his
hoof
is
more
musical
than
the
pipe
of
hermes
orleans
he
s
of
the
colour
of
the
nutmeg
dauphin
and
of
the
heat
of
the
ginger
it
is
a
beast
for
perseus
he
is
pure
air
and
fire
and
the
dull
elements
of
earth
and
water
never
appear
in
him
but
only
in
patient
stillness
while
his
rider
mounts
him
he
is
indeed
a
horse
and
all
other
jades
you
may
call
beasts
constable
indeed
my
lord
it
is
a
most
absolute
and
excellent
horse
dauphin
it
is
the
prince
of
palfreys
his
neigh
is
like
the
bidding
of
a
monarch
and
his
countenance
enforces
homage
orleans
no
more
cousin
dauphin
nay
the
man
hath
no
wit
that
cannot
from
the
rising
of
the
lark
to
the
lodging
of
the
lamb
vary
deserved
praise
on
my
palfrey
it
is
a
theme
as
fluent
as
the
sea
turn
the
sands
into
eloquent
tongues
and
my
horse
is
argument
for
them
all
tis
a
subject
for
a
sovereign
to
reason
on
and
for
a
sovereign
s
sovereign
to
ride
on
and
for
the
world
familiar
to
us
and
unknown
to
lay
apart
their
particular
functions
and
wonder
at
him
i
once
writ
a
sonnet
in
his
praise
and
began
thus
wonder
of
nature
orleans
i
have
heard
a
sonnet
begin
so
to
one
s
mistress
dauphin
then
did
they
imitate
that
which
i
composed
to
my
courser
for
my
horse
is
my
mistress
orleans
your
mistress
bears
well
dauphin
me
well
which
is
the
prescript
praise
and
perfection
of
a
good
and
particular
mistress
constable
nay
for
methought
yesterday
your
mistress
shrewdly
shook
your
back
dauphin
so
perhaps
did
yours
constable
mine
was
not
bridled
dauphin
o
then
belike
she
was
old
and
gentle
and
you
rode
like
a
kern
of
ireland
your
french
hose
off
and
in
your
straight
strossers
constable
you
have
good
judgment
in
horsemanship
dauphin
be
warned
by
me
then
they
that
ride
so
and
ride
not
warily
fall
into
foul
bogs
i
had
rather
have
my
horse
to
my
mistress
constable
i
had
as
lief
have
my
mistress
a
jade
dauphin
i
tell
thee
constable
my
mistress
wears
his
own
hair
constable
i
could
make
as
true
a
boast
as
that
if
i
had
a
sow
to
my
mistress
dauphin
le

retourne
a
son
propre

et
la

thou
makest

yet
do
i
not
use
my
horse
for
my
mistress
or
any
such
proverb
so
little
kin
to
the
purpose
rambures
my
lord
constable
the
armour
that
i
saw
in
your
tent
to
night
are
those
stars
or
suns
upon
it
constable
stars
my
lord
dauphin
some
of
them
will
fall
to
morrow
i
hope
constable
and
yet
my
sky
shall
not
want
dauphin
that
may
be
for
you
bear
a
many
superfluously
and
twere
more
honour
some
were
away
constable
even
as
your
horse
bears
your
praises
who
would
trot
as
well
were
some
of
your
brags
dismounted
dauphin
would
i
were
able
to
load
him
with
his
desert
will
it
never
be
day
i
will
trot
to
morrow
a
mile
and
my
way
shall
be
paved
with
english
faces
constable
i
will
not
say
so
for
fear
i
should
be
faced
out
of
my
way
but
i
would
it
were
morning
for
i
would
fain
be
about
the
ears
of
the
english
rambures
who
will
go
to
hazard
with
me
for
twenty
prisoners
constable
you
must
first
go
yourself
to
hazard
ere
you
have
them
dauphin
tis
midnight
i
ll
go
arm
myself
exit
orleans
the
dauphin
longs
for
morning
rambures
he
longs
to
eat
the
english
constable
i
think
he
will
eat
all
he
kills
orleans
by
the
white
hand
of
my
lady
he
s
a
gallant
prince
constable
swear
by
her
foot
that
she
may
tread
out

he
is
simply
the
most
active
gentleman
of
france
constable
doing
is
activity
and
he
will
still
be
doing
orleans
he
never
did
harm
that
i
heard
of
constable
nor
will
do
none
to
morrow
he
will
keep
that
good
name
still
orleans
i
know
him
to
be
valiant
constable
i
was
told
that
by
one
that
knows
him
better
than
you
orleans
what
s
he
constable
marry
he
told
me
so
himself
and
he
said
he
cared
not
who
knew
it
orleans
he
needs
not
it
is
no
hidden
virtue
in
him
constable
by
my
faith
sir
but
it
is
never
any
body
saw
it
but
his
lackey
tis
a
hooded
valour
and
when
it
appears
it
will
bate
orleans
ill
will
never
said
well

i
will
cap
that
proverb
with

so
far
out

if

they
would

not
that
the

but
we
have
no
great
cause
to
desire
the
approach
of
day
williams
we
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day
but
i
think
we
shall
never
see
the
end
of
it
who
goes
there
king

under
what
captain
serve
you

good

kind

pray
you
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate
king
henry
v
even
as
men
wrecked
upon
a
sand
that
look
to
be
washed
off
the
next
tide
bates
he
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
king
king
henry
v
no
nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should
for
though
i
speak
it
to
you
i
think
the
king
is
but
a
man
as
i
am
the
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
the
element
shows
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
all
his
senses
have
but
human
conditions
his
ceremonies
laid
by
in
his
nakedness
he
appears
but
a
man
and
though
his
affections
are
higher
mounted
than
ours
yet
when
they
stoop
they
stoop
with
the
like
wing
therefore
when
he
sees
reason
of
fears
as
we
do
his
fears
out
of
doubt
be
of
the
same
relish
as
ours
are
yet
in
reason
no
man
should
possess
him
with
any
appearance
of
fear
lest
he
by
showing
it
should
dishearten
his
army
bates
he
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will
but
i
believe
as
cold
a
night
as
tis
he
could
wish
himself
in
thames
up
to
the
neck
and
so
i
would
he
were
and
i
by
him
at
all
adventures
so
we
were
quit
here
king
henry
v
by
my
troth
i
will
speak
my
conscience
of
the
king
i
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
any
where
but
where
he
is
bates
then
i
would
he
were
here
alone
so
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed
and
a
many
poor
men
s
lives
saved
king
henry
v
i
dare
say
you
love
him
not
so
ill
to
wish
him
here
alone
howsoever
you
speak
this
to
feel
other
men
s
minds
methinks
i
could
not
die
any
where
so
contented
as
in
the
king
s
company
his
cause
being
just
and
his
quarrel
honourable
williams
that
s
more
than
we
know
bates
ay
or
more
than
we
should
seek
after
for
we
know
enough
if
we
know
we
are
the
kings
subjects
if
his
cause
be
wrong
our
obedience
to
the
king
wipes
the
crime
of
it
out
of
us
williams
but
if
the
cause
be
not
good
the
king
himself
hath
a
heavy
reckoning
to
make
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
and
heads
chopped
off
in
battle
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day
and
cry
all
we
died
at
such
a
place
some
swearing
some
crying
for
a
surgeon
some
upon
their
wives
left
poor
behind
them
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left
i
am
afeard
there
are
few
die
well
that
die
in
a
battle
for
how
can
they
charitably
dispose
of
any
thing
when
blood
is
their
argument
now
if
these
men
do
not
die
well
it
will
be
a
black
matter
for
the
king
that
led
them
to
it
whom
to
disobey
were
against
all
proportion
of
subjection
king
henry
v
so
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
sent
about
merchandise
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness
by
your
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father
that
sent
him
or
if
a
servant
under
his
master
s
command
transporting
a
sum
of
money
be
assailed
by
robbers
and
die
in
many
irreconciled
iniquities
you
may
call
the
business
of
the
master
the
author
of
the
servant
s
damnation
but
this
is
not
so
the
king
is
not
bound
to
answer
the
particular
endings
of
his
soldiers
the
father
of
his
son
nor
the
master
of
his
servant
for
they
purpose
not
their
death
when
they
purpose
their
services
besides
there
is
no
king
be
his
cause
never
so
spotless
if
it
come
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
can
try
it
out
with
all
unspotted
soldiers
some
peradventure
have
on
them
the
guilt
of
premeditated
and
contrived
murder
some
of
beguiling
virgins
with
the
broken
seals
of
perjury
some
making
the
wars
their
bulwark
that
have
before
gored
the
gentle
bosom
of
peace
with
pillage
and
robbery
now
if
these
men
have
defeated
the
law
and
outrun
native
punishment
though
they
can
outstrip
men
they
have
no
wings
to
fly
from
god
war
is
his
beadle
war
is
vengeance
so
that
here
men
are
punished
for
before
breach
of
the
king
s
laws
in
now
the
king
s
quarrel
where
they
feared
the
death
they
have
borne
life
away
and
where
they
would
be
safe
they
perish
then
if
they
die
unprovided
no
more
is
the
king
guilty
of
their
damnation
than
he
was
before
guilty
of
those
impieties
for
the
which
they
are
now
visited
every
subject
s
duty
is
the
king
s
but
every
subject
s
soul
is
his
own
therefore
should
every
soldier
in
the
wars
do
as
every
sick
man
in
his
bed
wash
every
mote
out
of
his
conscience
and
dying
so
death
is
to
him
advantage
or
not
dying
the
time
was
blessedly
lost
wherein
such
preparation
was
gained
and
in
him
that
escapes
it
were
not
sin
to
think
that
making
god
so
free
an
offer
he
let
him
outlive
that
day
to
see
his
greatness
and
to
teach
others
how
they
should
prepare
williams
tis
certain
every
man
that
dies
ill
the
ill
upon
his
own
head
the
king
is
not
to
answer
it
bates
but
i
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me
and
yet
i
determine
to
fight
lustily
for
him
king
henry
v
i
myself
heard
the
king
say
he
would
not
be
ransomed
williams
ay
he
said
so
to
make
us
fight
cheerfully
but
when
our
throats
are
cut
he
may
be
ransomed
and
we
ne
er
the
wiser
king
henry
v
if
i
live
to
see
it
i
will
never
trust
his
word
after
williams
you
pay
him
then
that
s
a
perilous
shot
out
of
an
elder
gun
that
a
poor
and
private
displeasure
can
do
against
a
monarch
you
may
as
well
go
about
to
turn
the
sun
to
ice
with
fanning
in
his
face
with
a
peacock
s
feather
you
ll
never
trust
his
word
after
come
tis
a
foolish
saying
king
henry
v
your
reproof
is
something
too
round
i
should
be
angry
with
you
if
the
time
were
convenient
williams
let
it
be
a
quarrel
between
us
if
you
live
king
henry

embrace
it

how
shall
i
know
thee
again
king

give
me
any
gage
of
thine
and
i
will

it
i
will
make
it
my

my

me
another
of
thine

this
will

in

me

i
will

him
to

fertile
france
put
up
her
lovely
visage
alas
she
hath
from
france
too
long
been
chased
and
all
her
husbandry
doth
lie
on
heaps
corrupting
in
its
own
fertility
her
vine
the
merry
cheerer
of
the
heart
unpruned
dies

hedges
even
pleach
d
like

wildly
overgrown
with

d
twigs
her
fallow
leas
the
darnel
hemlock
and
rank
fumitory
doth
root
upon
while
that
the
coulter
rusts
that
should
deracinate
such
savagery
the
even
mead

brought
sweetly
forth

freckled
cowslip

green
clover

idleness

nothing
teems
but
hateful
docks
rough
thistles
kecksies
burs
losing
both
beauty
and
utility

as
our
vineyards
fallows
meads
and
hedges
defective
in
their
natures
grow
to
wildness
even
so
our
houses
and
ourselves
and
children
have
lost
or
do
not
learn
for
want
of
time
the
sciences
that
should
become
our
country
but
grow
like
savages
as
soldiers
will
that
nothing
do
but
meditate
on
blood
to
swearing
and
stern
looks
diffused
attire
and
every
thing
that
seems
unnatural
which
to
reduce
into
our
former
favour
you
are
assembled
and
my
speech
entreats

i
may
know
the
let

her
former
qualities

if

couldst
thou
wouldst
find

a
plain
king
that
thou
wouldst
think
i
had
sold
my
farm
to
buy
my
crown
i
know
no
ways
to
mince
it
in
love
but
directly
to
say
i
love
you
then
if
you
urge

vell
king
henry
v
marry
if
you
would
put
me
to
verses
or
to
dance
for
your
sake
kate
why
you
undid
me
for
the
one
i
have
neither
words
nor
measure
and
for
the
other
i
have
no
strength
in
measure
yet
a
reasonable
measure
in
strength
if
i
could
win
a
lady
at
leap
frog
or
by
vaulting
into
my
saddle
with
my
armour
on
my
back
under
the
correction
of
bragging
be
it
spoken
i
should
quickly
leap
into
a
wife
or
if
i
might
buffet
for
my
love
or
bound
my
horse
for
her
favours
i
could
lay
on
like
a
butcher
and
sit
like
a
jack
an
apes
never
off
but
before
god
kate
i
cannot
look
greenly
nor
gasp
out
my
eloquence
nor
i
have
no
cunning
in
protestation
only
downright
oaths
which
i
never
use
till
urged
nor
never
break
for
urging
if
thou
canst
love
a
fellow
of
this
temper
kate
whose
face
is
not
worth
sun
burning
that
never
looks
in
his
glass
for
love
of
any
thing
he
sees
there
let
thine
eye
be
thy
cook
i
speak
to
thee
plain
soldier
if
thou
canst
love
me
for
this
take
me
if
not
to
say
to
thee
that
i
shall
die
is
true
but
for
thy
love
by
the
lord
no
yet
i
love
thee
too
and
while
thou
livest
dear
kate
take
a
fellow
of
plain
and
uncoined
constancy
for
he
perforce
must
do
thee
right
because
he
hath
not
the
gift
to
woo
in
other
places
for
these
fellows
of
infinite
tongue
that
can
rhyme
themselves
into
ladies
favours
they
do
always
reason
themselves
out
again
what
a
speaker
is
but
a
prater
a
rhyme
is
but
a
ballad
a
good
leg
will
fall
a
straight
back
will
stoop
a
black
beard
will
turn
white
a
curled
pate
will
grow
bald
a
fair
face
will
wither
a
full
eye
will
wax
hollow
but
a
good
heart
kate
is
the
sun
and
the
moon
or
rather
the
sun
and
not
the
moon
for
it
shines
bright
and
never
changes
but
keeps
his
course
truly
if
thou
would
have
such
a
one
take
me
and
take
me
take
a
soldier
take
a
soldier
take
a
king
and
what
sayest
thou
then
to
my
love
speak
my
fair
and
fairly
i
pray
thee
katharine
is
it
possible
dat
i
sould
love
de
enemy
of
france
king
henry
v
no
it
is
not
possible
you
should
love
the
enemy
of
france
kate
but
in
loving
me
you
should
love
the
friend
of
france
for
i
love
france
so
well
that
i
will
not
part
with
a
village
of
it
i
will
have
it
all
mine
and
kate
when
france
is
mine
and
i
am
yours
then
yours
is
france
and
you
are
mine
katharine
i
cannot
tell
vat
is
dat
king
henry
v
no
kate
i
will
tell
thee
in
french
which
i
am
sure
will
hang
upon
my
tongue
like
a
new
married
wife
about
her
husband
s
neck
hardly
to
be
shook
off
je
quand
sur
le
possession
de

let
me
see
what
then
saint
denis
be
my
speed
donc
votre
est
france
et
vous
etes
mienne
it
is
as
easy
for
me
kate
to
conquer
the
kingdom
as
to
speak
so
much
more
french
i
shall
never
move
thee
in
french
unless
it
be
to
laugh
at
me
katharine
sauf
votre
honneur
le
francois
que
vous
parlez
il
est
meilleur
que
l
anglois
lequel
je
parle
king
henry
v
no
faith
is
t
not
kate
but
thy
speaking
of
my
tongue
and
i
thine
most
truly
falsely
must
needs
be
granted
to
be
much
at
one
but
kate
dost
thou
understand
thus
much
english
canst
thou
love
me
katharine
i
cannot
tell
king
henry
v
can
any
of
your
neighbours
tell
kate
i
ll
ask
them
come
i
know
thou
lovest
me
and
at
night
when
you
come
into
your
closet
you
ll
question
this
gentlewoman
about
me
and
i
know
kate
you
will
to
her
dispraise
those
parts
in
me
that
you
love
with
your
heart
but
good
kate
mock
me
mercifully
the
rather
gentle
princess
because
i
love
thee
cruelly
if
ever
thou
beest
mine
kate
as
i
have
a
saving
faith
within
me
tells
me
thou
shalt
i
get
thee
with
scambling
and
thou
must
therefore
needs
prove
a
good
soldier
breeder
shall
not
thou
and
i
between
saint
denis
and
saint
george
compound
a
boy
half
french
half
english
that
shall
go
to
constantinople
and
take
the
turk
by
the
beard
shall
we

to
flatter
me
that
thou
dost
notwithstanding
the
poor
and
untempering
effect
of
my
visage
now
beshrew
my
father
s
ambition
he
was
thinking
of
civil
wars
when

a
stubborn
outside

would

king
henry

kate
nice
customs
curtsy
to

dear
kate
you
and
i
cannot
be
confined
within
the
weak
list
of
a
country
s
fashion
we
are
the
makers
of
manners
kate
and
the
liberty
that
follows
our
places
stops
the
mouth
of
all
find
faults
as
i
will
do
yours
for
upholding
the
nice
fashion
of
your
country
in
denying
me
a
kiss
therefore
patiently
and
yielding
kissing
her
you
have
witchcraft
in
your
lips
kate
there
is
more
eloquence
in
a
sugar
touch
of
them
than
in
the
tongues
of
the
french
council
and
they
should
sooner
persuade
harry
of
england
than
a
general
petition
of
monarchs
here
comes
your
father
re
enter
the
french
king
and
his
queen
burgundy
and
other
lords
burgundy
god
save
your
majesty
my
royal
cousin
teach
you
our
princess
english
king
henry
v
i
would
have
her
learn
my
fair
cousin
how
perfectly
i
love
her
and
that
is
good
english
burgundy
is
she
not
apt
king
henry
v
our
tongue
is
rough
coz
and
my
condition
is
not
smooth
so
that
having
neither
the
voice
nor
the
heart
of
flattery
about
me
i
cannot
so
conjure
up
the
spirit
of
love
in
her
that
he
will
appear
in
his
true
likeness
burgundy
pardon
the
frankness
of
my
mirth
if
i
answer
you
for
that
if
you
would
conjure
in
her
you
must
make
a
circle
if
conjure
up
love
in
her
in
his
true
likeness
he
must
appear
naked
and
blind
can
you
blame
her
then
being
a
maid
yet
rosed
over
with
the
virgin
crimson
of
modesty
if
she
deny
the
appearance
of
a
naked
blind
boy
in
her
naked
seeing
self
it
were
my
lord
a
hard
condition
for
a
maid
to
consign
to
king
henry
v
yet
they
do
wink
and
yield
as
love
is
blind
and
enforces
burgundy
they
are
then
excused
my
lord
when
they
see
not
what
they
do
king
henry
v
then
good
my
lord
teach
your
cousin
to
consent
winking
burgundy
i
will
wink
on
her
to
consent
my
lord
if
you
will
teach
her
to
know
my
meaning
for
maids
well
summered
and
warm
kept
are
like
flies
at
bartholomew
tide
blind
though
they
have
their
eyes
and
then
they
will
endure
handling
which
before
would
not
abide
looking
on
king
henry
v
this
moral
ties
me
over
to
time
and
a
hot
summer
and
so
i
shall
catch
the
fly
your
cousin
in
the
latter
end
and
she
must
be
blind
too
burgundy
as
love
is
my
lord
before
it
loves
king
henry
v
it
is
so
and
you
may
some
of
you
thank
love
for
my
blindness
who
cannot
see
many
a
fair
french
city
for
one
fair
french
maid
that
stands
in
my
way
french
king
yes
my
lord
you
see
them
perspectively
the
cities
turned
into
a
maid

all
girdled
with
maiden
walls
that
war
hath
never
entered
king
henry
v
shall
kate
be
my
wife
french
king
so
please
you

of

wait
on
her
