in

palace
enter
camillo
and
archidamus
archidamus
if
you
shall
chance
camillo
to
visit
bohemia
on
the
like
occasion
whereon
my
services
are
now
on
foot
you
shall
see
as
i
have
said
great
difference
betwixt
our
bohemia
and
your
sicilia
camillo
i
think
this
coming
summer
the
king
of
sicilia
means
to
pay
bohemia
the
visitation
which
he
justly
owes
him
archidamus
wherein
our
entertainment
shall
shame
us
we
will
be
justified
in
our
loves
for
indeed
camillo
beseech
you
archidamus
verily
i
speak
it
in
the
freedom
of
my
knowledge
we
cannot
with
such
magnificence
in
so
rare
i
know
not
what
to
say
we
will
give
you
sleepy
drinks
that
your
senses
unintelligent
of
our
insufficience
may
though
they
cannot
praise
us
as
little
accuse
us
camillo
you
pay
a
great
deal
too
dear
for
what
s
given
freely
archidamus
believe
me
i
speak
as
my
understanding
instructs
me
and
as
mine
honesty
puts
it
to
utterance
camillo
sicilia
cannot
show
himself
over
kind
to
bohemia
they
were
trained
together
in
their
childhoods
and
there
rooted
betwixt
them
then
such
an
affection
which
cannot
choose
but
branch
now
since
their
more
mature
dignities
and
royal
necessities
made
separation
of
their
society
their
encounters
though
not
personal
have
been
royally
attorneyed
with
interchange
of
gifts
letters
loving
embassies
that
they
have
seemed
to
be
together
though
absent
shook
hands
as
over
a
vast
and
embraced
as
it
were
from
the
ends
of
opposed
winds
the
heavens
continue
their
loves
archidamus
i
think
there
is
not
in
the
world
either
malice
or
matter
to
alter
it
you
have
an
unspeakable
comfort
of
your
young
prince
mamillius
it
is
a
gentleman
of
the
greatest
promise
that
ever
came
into
my
note
camillo
i
very
well
agree
with
you
in
the
hopes
of
him
it
is
a
gallant
child
one
that
indeed
physics
the
subject
makes
old
hearts
fresh
they
that
went
on
crutches
ere
he
was
born
desire
yet
their
life
to
see
him
a
man
archidamus
would
they
else
be
content
to
die
camillo
yes
if
there
were
no
other
excuse
why
they
should
desire
to
live
archidamus
if
the
king
had
no
son
they
would
desire
to
live
on
crutches
till
he
had
one
exeunt

be
negligent
foolish

one
of

no

that
his
negligence
his
folly
fear
among
the
infinite
doings
of
the

sometime
puts
forth
in
your
affairs
my
lord
if
ever
i
were
wilful
negligent
it
was
my
folly
if
industriously
i
play
d
the
fool
it
was
my
negligence
not
weighing
well
the
end
if
ever
fearful
to
do
a
thing
where
i
the
issue
doubted
where
of
the
execution
did
cry
out
against
the

twas
a

which
oft
infects
the

these
my

are
such
allow
d
infirmities
that
honesty
is
never

of
but
beseech
your
grace
be
plainer
with
me
let
me
know
my
trespass
by
its
own
visage
if
i
then
deny
it
tis
none
of
mine
leontes
ha
not
you
seen
camillo
but
that
s
past
doubt
you
have
or
your

glass
is
thicker
than
a
cuckold
s
horn
or
heard
for
to
a
vision
so
apparent
rumour
cannot
be
mute
or
thought
for

resides
not
in
that
man
that
does
not
think
my

is
slippery
if
thou
wilt
confess
or
else
be
impudently
negative
to
have
nor
eyes
nor

nor

then
say
my

s
a

horse
deserves
a

as
rank
as
any
flax
wench
that
puts
to
before
her
troth
plight
say
t
and

t
camillo
i
would
not
be
a

by
to
hear
my
sovereign
mistress
clouded
so
without
my
present
vengeance
taken
shrew
my
heart
you
never
spoke
what
did
become
you
less
than
this
which
to
reiterate
were
sin
as
deep
as
that
though
true
leontes
is
whispering
nothing
is
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
is
meeting
noses
kissing
with
inside
lip
stopping
the
career
of
laughing
with
a
sigh
a
note
infallible
of
breaking
honesty
horsing
foot
on

skulking
in
corners
wishing
clocks
more
swift
hours
minutes
noon
midnight
and
all
eyes
blind
with
the
pin
and

but
theirs
theirs
only
that

this
nothing
why
then
the

all
that

the

my

if
this

camillo
good
my
lord
be
cured
of
this
diseased
opinion
and
betimes
for
tis
most
dangerous
leontes
say
it
be
tis
true
camillo
no
no
my
lord
leontes
it
is
you
lie
you
lie
i
say
thou
liest
camillo
and
i
hate
thee
pronounce
thee
a
gross
lout
a
mindless
slave
or
else
a
hovering
temporizer
that
canst
with
thine
eyes
at
once
see
good
and
evil
inclining
to
them
both
were
my
wife
s
liver
infected
as
her
life
she
would
not
live
the
running
of
one
glass
camillo
who
does
infect
her
leontes
why
he
that
wears
her
like
a
medal
hanging
about
his
neck
bohemia
who
if
i
had
servants
true
about
me
that
bare
eyes
to
see
alike
mine
honour
as
their
profits
their
own
particular
thrifts
they
would
do
that
which
should
undo
more
doing
ay
and
thou
his
cupbearer
whom
i
from
meaner
form
have
benched
and
reared
to
worship
who
mayst
see
plainly
as
heaven
sees
earth
and
earth
sees
heaven
how
i
am
galled
mightst
bespice
a
cup
to
give
mine
enemy
a
lasting
wink
which
draught
to
me
were
cordial
camillo
sir
my
lord
i
could
do
this
and
that
with
no
rash
potion
but
with
a
lingering
dram
that
should
not
work
maliciously
like
poison
but
i
cannot
believe
this
crack
to
be
in
my
dread
mistress
so
sovereignly
being
honourable
i
have
loved
thee
leontes
make
that
thy
question
and
go
rot
dost
think
i
am
so
muddy
so
unsettled
to
appoint
myself
in
this
vexation
sully
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
my
sheets
which
to
preserve
is
sleep
which
being
spotted
is
goads
thorns
nettles
tails
of
wasps
give
scandal
to
the
blood
o
the
prince
my
son
who
i
do
think
is
mine
and
love
as
mine
without
ripe
moving
to
t
would
i
do
this
could
man
so
blench
camillo
i
must
believe
you
sir
i
do
and
will
fetch
off
bohemia
for
t
provided
that
when
he
s
removed
your
highness
will
take
again
your
queen
as
yours
at
first
even
for
your
son
s
sake
and
thereby
for
sealing
the
injury
of
tongues
in
courts
and
kingdoms
known
and
allied
to
yours
leontes
thou
dost
advise
me
even
so
as
i
mine
own
course
have
set
down
i
ll
give
no
blemish
to
her
honour
none
camillo
my
lord
go
then
and
with
a
countenance
as
clear
as
friendship
wears
at
feasts
keep
with
bohemia
and
with
your
queen
i
am
his
cupbearer
if
from
me
he
have
wholesome
beverage
account
me
not
your
servant
leontes
this
is
all
do
t
and
thou
hast
the
one
half
of
my
heart
do
t
not
thou
split
st
thine
own
camillo
i
ll
do
t
my
lord
leontes
i
will
seem
friendly
as
thou
hast
advised
me
exit
camillo
o
miserable
lady
but
for
me
what
case
stand
i
in
i
must
be
the
poisoner
of
good
polixenes
and
my
ground
to
do
t
is
the
obedience
to
a
master
one
who
in
rebellion
with
himself
will
have
all
that
are
his
so
too
to
do
this
deed
promotion
follows
if
i
could
find
example
of
thousands
that
had
struck
anointed
kings
and
flourish
d
after
i
ld
not
do
t
but
since
nor
brass
nor
stone
nor
parchment
bears
not
one
let
villany
itself
forswear
t
i
must
forsake
the
court
to
do
t
or
no
is
certain
to
me
a
break
neck
happy
star
reign
now
here
comes
bohemia

is
strange
methinks
my

most
royal
sir
polixenes
what
is
the
news
i
the
court
camillo
none
rare
my
lord
polixenes
the
king
hath
on
him
such
a
countenance
as
he
had
lost
some
province
and
a
region
loved
as
he
loves
himself
even
now
i
met
him
with
customary
compliment
when
he
wafting
his
eyes
to
the
contrary
and
falling
a
lip
of
much
contempt
speeds
from
me
and
so
leaves
me
to
consider
what
is
breeding
that
changeth
thus
his
manners
camillo
i
dare
not
know
my
lord
polixenes
how
dare
not
do
not
do
you
know
and
dare
not
be
intelligent
to
me
tis
thereabouts
for
to
yourself
what
you
do
know
you
must
and
cannot
say
you
dare
not
good
camillo
your
changed
complexions
are
to
me
a
mirror
which
shows
me
mine
changed
too
for
i
must
be
a
party
in
this
alteration
finding
myself
thus
alter
d
with
t
camillo
there
is
a
sickness
which
puts
some
of
us
in
distemper
but
i
cannot
name
the
disease
and
it
is
caught
of
you
that
yet
are
well
polixenes

me
not

sped

a
gentleman

no

adorns
our

polixenes
a
sickness
caught
of
me
and
yet
i
well
i
must
be
answer
d
dost
thou
hear
camillo
i
conjure
thee
by
all
the
parts
of
man
which
honour
does
acknowledge
whereof
the
least
is
not
this
suit
of
mine
that
thou
declare
what
incidency
thou
dost
guess
of
harm
is
creeping
toward
me
how
far
off
how
near
which
way
to
be
prevented
if
to
be
if
not
how
best
to
bear
it
camillo
sir
i
will
tell
you
since
i
am
charged
in
honour
and
by
him
that
i
think
honourable
therefore
mark
my
counsel
which
must
be
even
as
swiftly
follow
d
as
i
mean
to
utter
it
or
both
yourself
and
me
cry
lost
and
so
good
night
polixenes
on
good
camillo
camillo
i
am
appointed
him
to
murder
you
polixenes
by
whom
camillo
camillo
by
the
king
polixenes
for
what
camillo
he
thinks
nay
with
all
confidence
he
swears
as
he
had
seen
t
or
been
an
instrument
to
vice
you
to
t
that
you
have
touch
d
his
queen
forbiddenly
polixenes
o
then
my
best
blood
turn
to
an
infected
jelly
and
my
name
be
yoked
with
his
that
did
betray
the
best
turn
then
my
freshest
reputation
to
a
savour
that
may
strike
the
dullest
nostril
where
i
arrive
and
my
approach
be
shunn
d
nay
hated
too
worse
than
the
great
st
infection
that
e
er
was
heard
or
read
camillo
swear
his
thought
over
by
each
particular
star
in
heaven
and
by
all
their
influences
you
may
as
well
forbid
the
sea
for
to
obey
the
moon
as
or
by
oath
remove
or
counsel
shake
the
fabric
of
his
folly
whose
foundation
is
piled
upon
his
faith
and
will
continue
the
standing
of
his
body
polixenes
how
should
this
grow
camillo
i
know
not
but
i
am
sure
tis
safer
to
avoid
what
s
grown
than
question
how
tis
born
if
therefore
you
dare
trust
my
honesty
that
lies
enclosed
in
this
trunk
which
you
shall
bear
along
impawn
d
away
to

i
will
whisper
to
the
business

will
by
twos

for
myself
i

put
my
fortunes

not
uncertain
for
by
the
honour
of
my
parents
i
have
utter
d
truth
which
if
you
seek
to
prove
i
dare
not
stand
by
nor
shall
you
be
safer
than
one
condemn

by
the
king

own
mouth

this

is
for
a
precious
creature
as
she

rare
must
it
be

as

for
this
her
without

or
ha
these
petty
brands
that
calumny
doth
use
o
i
am
out
that

shrugs
these
hums

when
you

said
she

goodly
come
between
ere
you
can
say
she

honest
but
be
t
known
from
him
that

before

how
i
was
in
your

how
merited
to
be
so
since
he
came

any

wanted

to
gainsay
what
they
did
than
to
perform
it
first
hermione
that
s
true
enough
through
tis
a

sir
not
due

leontes
you
will
not
own
it

more
than
mistress
of

comes
to
me
in

of

i
must
not
at
all
acknowledge
for
polixenes
with
whom
i
am
accused
i
do
confess
i
loved
him
as
in
honour
he
required
with
such
a
kind
of
love
as
might
become
a
lady
like
me
with
a
love
even
such
so
and
no
other
as
yourself
commanded
which
not
to
have
done
i
think
had
been
in
me
both
disobedience
and
ingratitude
to
you
and
toward
your
friend
whose
love
had
spoke
even
since
it
could
speak
from
an
infant
freely
that
it
was
yours
now
for
conspiracy
i
know
not
how
it
tastes
though
it
be
dish
d
for
me
to
try
how
all
i
know
of
it
is
that
camillo
was
an
honest
man
and
why
he
left
your
court
the
gods
themselves
wotting
no
more
than
i

you

my

your

a

by

and
i
but

d
it
as
you
were
past
all
shame
those
of
your
fact
are
so
so
past
all

which
to
deny
concerns
more
than
avails
for
as
thy
brat
hath
been
cast
out
like
to
itself
no
father
owning
it
which
is
indeed
more
criminal
in
thee
than
it

thou
shalt
feel
our

in

passage
look
for
no
less
than
death
hermione
sir
spare
your

the

you

fright
me
with

can

the
crown
and

of

your

i
lay
thrice

gasping
to
begin
some
speech
her
eyes
became
two
spouts
the
fury
spent

hath
made
thy

froth

thrust
a
cork
into
a
hogshead
and
then
for
the
land
service
to
see
how
the
bear
tore
out
his
shoulder

how
he
cried
to
me
for
help
and
said
his
name
was
antigonus
a
nobleman
but
to
make
an
end
of
the
ship
to
see
how
the
sea
flap
dragoned
it
but
first
how
the
poor
souls
roared
and
the
sea
mocked
them
and
how
the
poor

roared
and
the
bear
mocked
him

roaring
louder

sixteen
years

seems
to
it
your

i
turn
my
glass
and
give
my
scene
such
growing
as
you
had
slept
between
leontes
leaving
the
effects
of
his
fond
jealousies
so
grieving
that
he
shuts
up
himself
imagine
me
gentle
spectators
that
i
now
may
be
in
fair
bohemia
and
remember
well
i
mentioned
a
son
o
the
king

florizel
i
now
name
to
you
and
with
speed
so
pace
to
speak
of

now
grown
in
grace
equal
with
wondering
what
of
her
ensues
i
list
not
prophecy
but
let
time
s
news
be
known
when
tis
brought
forth
a
shepherd
s
daughter
and
what
to
her
adheres
which
follows
after
is
the
argument
of
time
of
this
allow
if
ever
you
have
spent
time
worse
ere
now
if
never
yet
that

doth

earnestly
you
never
may

camillo
polixenes
i
pray
thee
good
camillo
be
no
more
importunate
tis
a
sickness
denying
thee
any
thing
a
death
to
grant
this
camillo
it
is
fifteen
years
since
i
saw
my
country
though
i
have
for
the
most
part
been
aired
abroad
i
desire
to
lay
my
bones
there
besides
the
penitent
king
my
master
hath
sent
for
me
to
whose
feeling
sorrows
i
might
be
some
allay
or
i
o
erween
to
think
so
which
is
another
spur
to
my
departure
polixenes
as
thou
lovest
me
camillo
wipe
not
out
the
rest
of
thy
services
by
leaving
me
now
the
need
i
have
of
thee
thine
own
goodness
hath
made
better
not
to
have
had
thee
than
thus
to
want
thee
thou
having
made
me
businesses
which
none
without
thee
can
sufficiently
manage
must
either
stay
to
execute
them
thyself
or
take
away
with
thee
the
very
services
thou
hast
done
which
if
i
have
not
enough
considered
as
too
much
i
cannot
to
be
more
thankful
to
thee
shall
be
my
study
and
my
profit
therein
the
heaping
friendships
of
that
fatal
country
sicilia
prithee
speak
no
more
whose
very
naming
punishes
me
with
the
remembrance
of
that
penitent
as
thou
callest
him
and
reconciled
king
my
brother
whose
loss
of
his
most
precious
queen
and
children
are
even
now
to
be
afresh
lamented
say
to
me
when
sawest
thou
the
prince
florizel
my
son
kings
are
no
less
unhappy
their
issue
not
being
gracious
than
they
are
in
losing
them
when
they
have
approved
their
virtues
camillo
sir
it
is
three
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
what
his
happier
affairs
may
be
are
to
me
unknown
but
i
have
missingly
noted
he
is
of
late
much
retired
from
court
and
is
less
frequent
to
his
princely
exercises
than
formerly
he
hath
appeared
polixenes
i
have
considered
so
much
camillo
and
with
some
care
so
far
that
i
have
eyes
under
my
service
which
look
upon
his
removedness
from
whom
i
have
this
intelligence
that
he
is
seldom
from
the
house
of
a
most
homely
shepherd
a
man
they
say
that
from
very
nothing
and
beyond
the
imagination
of
his
neighbours
is
grown
into
an
unspeakable
estate
camillo
i
have
heard
sir
of
such
a
man
who
hath
a
daughter
of
most
rare
note
the
report
of
her
is
extended
more
than
can
be
thought
to
begin
from
such
a
cottage
polixenes
that
s
likewise
part
of
my
intelligence
but
i
fear
the
angle
that
plucks
our
son
thither
thou
shalt
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
we
will
not
appearing
what
we
are
have
some
question
with
the
shepherd
from
whose
simplicity
i
think
it
not
uneasy
to
get
the
cause
of
my
son
s
resort
thither
prithee
be
my
present
partner
in
this
business
and
lay
aside
the
thoughts
of
sicilia

i
willingly
obey
your
command

to
have
a
worthy

i
have
it
upon
his

report
and
i
believe
it
he
looks
like

he
says

think
so
too
for
never
gazed
the
moon
upon

water
as

read
as
twere
my

to
be

not
half
a
kiss
to
choose
who
loves
another
best
polixenes
she
dances
featly
shepherd
so
she
does

cold
fish

where
no

shovels
in

o
cursed
wretch
that
knew
st
this
was

wouldst
adventure
to

as
hardly
will
he
endure
your

till

it
cannot
fail
but
by
the
violation
of
my
faith
and
then
let
nature
crush

my

do
bid
it

camillo
this
is
desperate
sir
florizel
so
call
it

it
does
fulfil
my
vow
i
needs
must
think
it
honesty
camillo
not
for
bohemia

the
pomp
that

for
all
the
sun

of
dear
sicilia
and
that
unhappy
king
my
master
whom
i
so
much
thirst
to
see
florizel
now
good
camillo
i
am
so
fraught
with
curious
business
that
i
leave
out
ceremony
camillo
sir
i
think
you
have
heard
of
my
poor
services
i
the
love
that
i
have
borne
your
father
florizel
very
nobly
have
you
deserved
it
is
my
father
s
music
to
speak
your
deeds
not
little
of
his
care
to
have
them
recompensed
as
thought
on
camillo
well
my
lord
if
you
may
please
to
think
i
love
the
king
and
through
him
what
is
nearest
to
him
which
is
your
gracious
self
embrace
but
my
direction
if
your
more
ponderous
and
settled
project
may
suffer
alteration
on
mine
honour
i
ll
point
you
where
you
shall
have
such
receiving
as
shall
become
your
highness
where
you
may
enjoy
your
mistress
from
the
whom
i
see
there
s
no
disjunction
to
be
made
but
by
as
heavens
forefend
your
ruin
marry
her
and
with
my
best
endeavours
in
your
absence
your
discontenting
father
strive
to
qualify
and
bring
him
up
to
liking
florizel
how
camillo
may
this
almost
a
miracle
be
done
that
i
may
call
thee
something
more
than
man
and
after
that
trust
to
thee
camillo
have
you
thought
on
a
place
whereto
you
ll
go
florizel
not
any
yet
but
as
the
unthought
on
accident
is
guilty
to
what
we
wildly
do
so
we
profess
ourselves
to
be
the
slaves
of
chance
and
flies
of
every
wind
that
blows
camillo
then
list
to
me
this
follows
if
you
will
not
change
your
purpose
but
undergo
this
flight
make
for
sicilia
and
there
present
yourself
and
your
fair
princess
for
so
i
see
she
must
be
fore
leontes
she
shall
be
habited
as
it
becomes
the
partner
of
your
bed
methinks
i
see
leontes
opening
his
free
arms
and
weeping
his
welcomes
forth
asks
thee
the
son
forgiveness
as
twere
i
the
father
s
person
kisses
the
hands
of
your
fresh
princess
o
er
and
o
er
divides
him
twixt
his
unkindness
and
his
kindness
the
one
he
chides
to
hell
and
bids
the
other
grow
faster
than
thought
or
time
florizel
worthy
camillo
what
colour
for
my
visitation
shall
i
hold
up
before
him
camillo
sent
by
the
king
your
father
to
greet
him
and
to
give
him
comforts
sir
the
manner
of
your
bearing
towards
him
with
what
you
as
from
your
father
shall
deliver
things
known
betwixt
us
three
i
ll
write
you
down
the
which
shall
point
you
forth
at
every
sitting
what
you
must
say
that
he
shall
not
perceive
but
that
you
have
your
father
s
bosom
there
and
speak
his
very
heart
florizel
i
am
bound
to
you
there
is
some
sap
in
this
camillo
a
cause
more
promising
than
a
wild
dedication
of
yourselves
to
unpath
d
waters
undream
d
shores
most
certain
to
miseries
enough
no
hope
to
help
you
but
as
you
shake
off
one
to
take
another
nothing
so
certain
as
your
anchors
who
do
their
best
office
if
they
can
but
stay
you
where
you
ll
be
loath
to
be
besides
you
know
prosperity
s
the
very
bond
of
love
whose
fresh
complexion
and
whose
heart
together
affliction
alters
perdita
one
of
these
is
true
i
think
affliction
may
subdue
the
cheek
but
not
take
in
the
mind
camillo
yea
say
you
so
there
shall
not

your

house

seven
years

as
she
is
i
the
rear
our
birth
camillo
i
cannot
say
tis
pity
she
lacks
instructions
for

seems
a
mistress
to
most
that

pardon

for
this
i

blush

been
hallowed
and
brought
a
benediction
to
the
buyer
by
which
means
i
saw
whose
purse
was
best
in
picture
and
what
i
saw
to
my
good
use
i
remembered
my
clown
who
wants
but
something
to
be
a
reasonable
man
grew
so
in
love
with
the
wenches
song
that
he
would
not
stir
his
pettitoes
till
he
had
both
tune
and
words
which
so
drew
the
rest
of
the
herd
to
me
that
all
their
other
senses
stuck
in
ears
you
might
have
pinched
a
placket
it
was
senseless
twas
nothing
to
geld
a
codpiece
of
a
purse
i
could
have
filed
keys
off
that
hung
in
chains
no
hearing
no
feeling
but
my
sir
s
song
and
admiring
the
nothing
of
it
so
that
in
this
time
of
lethargy
i
picked
and
cut
most
of
their
festival
purses
and
had
not
the
old
man
come
in
with
a
whoo
bub
against
his
daughter
and
the
king
s
son
and
scared
my
choughs
from

not
left

alive
in
the
whole
army

covert
take
your
sweetheart

hat
and
pluck

o
er
your

dismantle
you
and
as
you
can
disliken
the
truth
of
your
own
seeming
that
you
may
for
i
do
fear

over
to

get
undescried

i
see
the
play
so
lies
that
i
must
bear
a
part
camillo
no
remedy
have
you
done
there
florizel
should
i
now
meet
my
father
he
would
not
call

nay
you
shall
have
no

it
to

come
lady
come
farewell
my
friend
autolycus
adieu
sir
florizel
o
perdita
what
have
we
twain
forgot
pray
you
a
word
camillo
[aside]
what
i
do
next
shall
be
to
tell
the
king
of
this
escape
and
whither
they
are
bound
wherein
my
hope
is
i
shall
so
prevail
to
force
him
after
in
whose
company
i
shall
review
sicilia
for
whose
sight
i
have
a
woman
s
longing
florizel
fortune
speed
us
thus
we
set
on
camillo
to
the
sea
side
camillo
the
swifter
speed
the
better
exeunt
florizel
perdita
and
camillo
autolycus
i
understand
the
business
i
hear
it
to
have
an
open
ear
a
quick
eye
and
a
nimble
hand
is
necessary
for
a
cut
purse
a
good
nose
is
requisite
also
to
smell
out
work
for
the
other
senses
i
see
this
is
the
time
that
the
unjust
man
doth
thrive
what
an
exchange
had
this
been
without

what
a
boot
is
here
with
this
exchange
sure
the
gods
do
this
year
connive
at
us
and
we
may
do
any
thing
extempore
the
prince
himself
is
about
a
piece
of
iniquity
stealing
away
from
his
father
with
his
clog
at
his
heels
if
i
thought
it
were
a
piece
of
honesty
to
acquaint
the
king
withal
i
would
not
do
t
i
hold
it
the
more
knavery
to
conceal
it
and
therein
am
i
constant
to
my
profession
re

then
clown
she
being
none
of
your

so
your

is
not
to
be
punished
by
him
show
those
things
you

about

will
tell
the

and
his

too
who
i
may
say
is
no
honest
man
neither
to
his
father
nor
to
me
to
go
about
to
make
me
the
king
s
brother
in

clown
indeed
brother
in

the
farthest
off
you

have
been
to

dearer

a
great
courtier
shepherd
his

by
the
picking
on

cleomenes
sir
you
have
done
enough
and
have
perform
d
a
saint
like
sorrow
no
fault
could
you
make
which
you
have
not
redeem
d
indeed
paid
down
more
penitence
than
done
trespass
at
the
last
do
as
the
heavens
have
done
forget
your
evil
with
them
forgive
yourself
leontes
whilst
i
remember
her
and
her
virtues
i
cannot
forget
my
blemishes
in
them
and
so
still
think
of
the
wrong
i
did
myself
which
was
so
much
that
heirless
it
hath
made
my
kingdom
and
destroy
d
the
sweet
st
companion
that
e
er
man
bred
his
hopes
out
of
paulina
true
too
true
my
lord
if
one
by
one
you
wedded
all
the
world
or
from
the
all
that
are
took
something
good
to
make
a
perfect
woman
she
you
kill
d
would
be
unparallel
d
leontes
i
think
so
kill
d
she
i
kill
d
i
did
so
but
thou
strikest
me
sorely
to
say
i
did
it
is
as
bitter
upon
thy
tongue
as
in
my
thought
now
good
now
say
so
but
seldom
cleomenes
not
at
all
good
lady
you
might
have
spoken
a
thousand
things
that
would
have
done
the
time
more
benefit
and
graced
your
kindness
better
paulina
you
are
one
of
those
would
have
him
wed
again
dion
if
you
would
not
so
you
pity
not
the
state
nor
the
remembrance
of
his
most
sovereign
name
consider
little
what
dangers
by
his
highness
fail
of
issue
may
drop
upon
his
kingdom
and
devour
incertain
lookers
on
what
were
more
holy
than
to
rejoice
the
former
queen
is
well
what
holier
than
for
royalty
s
repair
for
present
comfort
and
for
future
good
to
bless
the
bed
of
majesty
again
with
a
sweet
fellow
to
t
paulina
there
is
none
worthy
respecting
her
that
s
gone
besides
the
gods
will
have
fulfill
d
their
secret
purposes
for
has
not
the
divine
apollo
said
is
t
not
the
tenor
of
his
oracle
that
king
leontes
shall
not
have
an
heir
till
his
lost
child
be
found
which
that
it
shall
is
all
as
monstrous
to
our
human
reason
as
my
antigonus
to
break
his
grave
and
come
again
to
me
who
on
my
life
did
perish
with
the
infant
tis
your
counsel
my
lord
should
to
the
heavens
be
contrary
oppose
against
their
wills
to
leontes
care
not
for
issue
the
crown
will
find
an
heir
great
alexander
left
his
to
the
worthiest
so
his
successor
was
like
to
be
the
best
leontes
good
paulina
who
hast
the
memory
of
hermione
i
know
in
honour
o
that
ever
i
had
squared
me
to
thy
counsel
then
even
now
i
might
have
look
d
upon
my
queen
s
full
eyes
have
taken
treasure
from
her
lips
paulina
and
left
them
more
rich
for
what
they
yielded
leontes
thou
speak
st
truth
no
more
such
wives
therefore
no
wife
one
worse
and
better
used
would
make
her
sainted
spirit
again
possess
her
corpse
and
on
this
stage
where
we
re
offenders
now
appear
soul
vex
d
and
begin
why
to
me
paulina
had
she
such
power
she
had
just
cause
leontes
she
had
and
would
incense
me
to
murder
her
i
married
paulina
i
should
so
were
i
the

that
walk
d

bid
you
mark
her

and
tell
me
for
what
dull
part
in

you
chose
her
then
i

shriek
that
even
your

and
the

by

then
good
my
lords
bear
witness
to
his

cleomenes
you
tempt
him
over
much

unless
another
as
like

as
is

picture
affront

cleomenes
good
madam
paulina
i
have
done
yet
if

you
will
give
me
the
office
to
choose

twenty
one
your

so
hit
in

him
and
speak
of
something
wildly

that
twixt

as

and
then
i
lost

seized

measured
to
look
upon

the
wrongs

exposed
this

the
fearful
usage
at

ungentle
of
the
dreadful
neptune

very
slowly
i
am
sorry
most
sorry

where
you
were
tied
in
duty
and
as
sorry
your

is
not
so
rich

though

to
change
our
loves
beseech
you

remember
since
you
owed
no
more
to

than
i
do
now
with
thought
of
such
affections
step
forth
mine
advocate
at
your
request
my
father
will
grant
precious
things
as
trifles
leontes
would
he
do
so
i
ld
beg
your
precious
mistress
which
he
counts
but
a
trifle
paulina
sir
my
liege
your
eye
hath
too
much
youth
in
t
not
a
month
fore
your
queen
died
she
was
more
worth
such
gazes
than
what
you
look
on
now
leontes
i
thought
of
her
even
in
these
looks
i
made
to
florizel
but
your
petition
is
yet
unanswer
d
i
will
to
your
father
your
honour
not
o
erthrown
by
your
desires
i
am
friend
to
them
and
you
upon
which
errand
i
now
go
toward
him
therefore
follow
me
and
mark
what
way
i
make
come
good
my
lord
exeunt
scene
ii
before
leontes
palace
enter
autolycus
and
a
gentleman
autolycus
beseech
you
sir
were
you
present
at
this
relation
first
gentleman
i
was
by
at
the
opening
of
the
fardel
heard
the
old
shepherd
deliver
the
manner
how
he
found
it
whereupon
after
a
little
amazedness
we
were
all
commanded
out
of
the
chamber
only
this
methought
i
heard
the
shepherd
say
he
found
the
child
autolycus
i
would
most
gladly
know
the
issue
of
it
first
gentleman
i
make
a
broken
delivery
of
the
business
but
the
changes
i
perceived
in
the
king
and
camillo
were
very
notes
of
admiration
they
seemed
almost
with
staring
on
one
another
to
tear
the
cases
of
their
eyes
there
was
speech
in
their
dumbness
language
in
their
very
gesture
they
looked
as
they
had
heard
of
a
world
ransomed
or
one
destroyed
a
notable
passion
of
wonder
appeared
in
them
but
the
wisest
beholder
that
knew
no
more
but
seeing
could
not
say
if
the
importance
were
joy
or
sorrow
but
in
the
extremity
of
the
one
it
must
needs
be
enter
another
gentleman
here
comes
a
gentleman
that
haply
knows
more
the
news
rogero
second
gentleman
nothing
but
bonfires
the
oracle
is
fulfilled
the
king
s
daughter
is
found
such
a
deal
of
wonder
is
broken
out
within
this
hour
that
ballad
makers
cannot
be
able
to
express
it
enter
a
third
gentleman
here
comes
the
lady
paulina
s
steward
he
can
deliver
you
more
how
goes
it
now
sir
this
news
which
is
called
true
is
so
like
an
old
tale
that
the
verity
of
it
is
in
strong
suspicion
has
the
king
found
his
heir
third
gentleman
most
true
if
ever
truth
were
pregnant
by
circumstance
that
which
you
hear
you
ll
swear
you
see
there
is
such
unity
in
the
proofs
the
mantle
of
queen
hermione
s
her
jewel
about
the
neck
of
it
the
letters
of
antigonus
found
with
it
which
they
know
to
be
his
character
the
majesty
of
the
creature
in
resemblance
of
the
mother
the
affection
of
nobleness
which
nature
shows
above
her
breeding
and
many
other
evidences
proclaim
her
with
all
certainty
to
be
the
king
s
daughter
did
you
see
the
meeting
of
the
two
kings
second
gentleman
no
third
gentleman
then
have
you
lost
a
sight
which
was
to
be
seen
cannot
be
spoken
of
there
might
you
have
beheld
one
joy
crown
another
so
and
in
such
manner
that
it
seemed
sorrow
wept
to
take
leave
of
them
for
their
joy
waded
in
tears
there
was
casting
up
of
eyes
holding
up
of
hands
with
countenances
of
such
distraction
that
they
were
to
be
known
by
garment
not
by
favour
our
king
being
ready
to
leap
out
of
himself
for
joy
of
his
found
daughter
as
if
that
joy
were
now
become
a
loss
cries
o
thy
mother
thy
mother
then
asks
bohemia
forgiveness
then
embraces
his
son
in
law
then
again
worries
he
his
daughter
with
clipping
her
now
he
thanks
the
old
shepherd
which
stands
by
like
a
weather
bitten
conduit
of
many
kings
reigns
i
never
heard
of
such
another
encounter
which
lames
report
to
follow
it
and
undoes
description
to
do
it
second
gentleman
what
pray
you
became
of
antigonus
that
carried
hence
the
child
third
gentleman
like
an
old
tale
still
which
will
have
matter
to
rehearse
though
credit
be
asleep
and
not
an
ear
open
he
was
torn
to
pieces
with
a
bear
this
avouches
the
shepherd
s
son
who
has
not
only
his
innocence
which
seems
much
to
justify
him
but
a
handkerchief
and
rings
of
his
that
paulina
knows
first
gentleman
what
became
of
his
bark
and
his
followers
third
gentleman
wrecked
the
same
instant
of
their
master
s
death
and
in
the
view
of
the
shepherd
so
that
all
the
instruments
which
aided
to
expose
the
child
were
even
then
lost
when
it
was
found
but
o
the
noble
combat
that
twixt
joy
and
sorrow
was
fought
in
paulina
she
had
one
eye
declined
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
another
elevated
that
the
oracle
was
fulfilled
she
lifted
the
princess
from
the
earth
and
so
locks
her
in
embracing
as
if
she
would
pin
her
to
her
heart
that
she
might
no
more
be
in
danger
of
losing
first
gentleman
the
dignity
of
this
act
was
worth
the
audience
of
kings
and
princes
for
by
such
was
it
acted
third
gentleman
one
of
the
prettiest
touches
of
all
and
that
which
angled
for
mine
eyes
caught
the
water
though
not
the
fish
was
when
at
the
relation
of
the
queen
s
death
with
the
manner
how
she
came
to
t
bravely
confessed
and
lamented
by
the
king
how
attentiveness
wounded
his
daughter
till
from
one
sign
of
dolour
to
another
she
did
with
an
alas
i
would
fain
say
bleed
tears
for
i
am
sure
my
heart
wept
blood
who
was
most
marble
there
changed
colour
some
swooned
all
sorrowed
if
all
the
world
could
have
seen
t
the
woe
had
been
universal
first
gentleman
are
they
returned
to
the
court
third
gentleman
no
the
princess
hearing
of
her
mother
s
statue
which
is
in
the
keeping
of
paulina
a
piece
many
years
in
doing
and
now
newly
performed
by
that
rare
italian
master
julio
romano
who
had
he
himself
eternity
and
could
put
breath
into
his
work
would
beguile
nature
of
her
custom
so
perfectly
he
is
her
ape
he
so
near
to
hermione
hath
done
hermione
that
they
say
one
would
speak
to
her
and
stand
in
hope
of
answer
thither
with
all
greediness
of
affection
are
they
gone
and
there
they
intend
to
sup
second
gentleman
i
thought
she
had
some
great
matter
there
in
hand
for
she
hath
privately
twice
or
thrice
a
day
ever
since
the
death
of
hermione
visited
that
removed
house
shall
we
thither
and
with
our
company
piece
the
rejoicing
first
gentleman
who
would
be
thence
that
has
the
benefit
of
access
every
wink
of
an
eye
some
new
grace
will
be
born
our
absence
makes
us
unthrifty
to
our
knowledge
let

along

at

time
overfond
of

shepherd

daughter

he
then
took
her

to
be
much

mystery

a

s
house
enter
leontes
polixenes
florizel
perdita
camillo
paulina
lords
and
attendants
leontes
o
grave
and
good
paulina
the
great
comfort
that
i
have
had
of
thee
paulina
what
sovereign
sir
i
did
not
well
i
meant
well
all
my
services
you
have
paid
home
but
that
you
have
vouchsafed
with
your
crown
d
brother
and
these
your
contracted
heirs
of
your
kingdoms
my
poor
house
to
visit
it
is
a
surplus
of
your
grace
which
never
my
life
may
last
to
answer
leontes
o
paulina
we
honour
you
with
trouble
but
we
came
to
see
the
statue
of
our
queen
your
gallery
have
we
pass
d
through
not
without
much
content
in
many
singularities
but
we
saw
not
that
which
my
daughter
came
to
look
upon
the
statue
of
her
mother
paulina
as
she
lived
peerless
so
her
dead
likeness
i
do
well
believe
excels
whatever
yet
you
look
d
upon
or
hand
of
man
hath
done
therefore
i
keep
it
lonely
apart
but
here
it
is
prepare
to
see
the
life
as
lively
mock
d
as
ever
still
sleep
mock
d
death
behold
and
say
tis
well
paulina
draws
a
curtain
and
discovers
hermione
standing
like
a
statue
i
like
your
silence
it
the
more
shows
off
your
wonder
but
yet
speak
first
you
my
liege
comes
it
not
something
near
leontes
her
natural
posture
chide
me
dear
stone
that
i
may
say
indeed
thou
art
hermione
or
rather
thou
art
she
in
thy
not
chiding
for
she
was
as
tender
as
infancy
and
grace
but
yet
paulina
hermione
was
not
so
much
wrinkled
nothing
so
aged
as
this
seems
polixenes
o
not
by
much
paulina
so
much
the
more
our
carver
s
excellence
which
lets
go
by
some
sixteen
years
and
makes
her
as
she
lived
now
leontes
as
now
she
might
have
done
so
much
to
my
good
comfort
as
it
is
now
piercing
to
my
soul
o
thus
she
stood
even
with
such
life
of
majesty
warm
life
as
now
it
coldly
stands
when
first
i
woo
d
her
i
am
ashamed
does
not
the
stone
rebuke
me
for
being
more
stone
than
it
o
royal
piece
there
s
magic
in
thy
majesty
which
has
my
evils
conjured
to
remembrance
and
from
thy
admiring
daughter
took
the
spirits
standing
like
stone
with
thee
perdita
and
give
me
leave
and
do
not
say
tis
superstition
that
i
kneel
and
then
implore
her
blessing
lady
dear
queen
that
ended
when
i
but
began
give
me
that
hand
of
yours
to
kiss
paulina
o
patience
the
statue
is
but
newly
fix
d
the
colour
s
not
dry
camillo
my
lord
your
sorrow
was
too
sore
laid
on
which
sixteen
winters
cannot
blow
away
so
many
summers
dry
scarce
any
joy
did
ever
so
long
live
no
sorrow
but
kill
d
itself
much
sooner
polixenes
dear
my
brother
let
him
that
was
the
cause
of
this
have
power
to
take
off
so
much
grief
from
you
as
he
will
piece
up
in
himself
paulina
indeed
my
lord
if
i
had
thought
the
sight
of
my
poor
image
would
thus
have
wrought
you
for
the
stone
is
mine
i
ld
not
have
show
d
it
leontes
do
not
draw
the
curtain
paulina
no
longer
shall
you
gaze
on
t
lest
your
fancy
may
think
anon
it
moves
leontes
let
be
let
be
would
i
were
dead
but
that
methinks
already
what
was
he
that
did
make
it
see
my
lord
would
you
not
deem
it
breathed
and
that
those
veins
did
verily
bear
blood
polixenes
masterly
done
the
very
life
seems
warm
upon
her
lip
leontes
the
fixture
of
her
eye
has
motion
in
t
as
we
are
mock
d
with
art
paulina
i
ll
draw
the
curtain
my
lord
s
almost
so
far
transported
that
he
ll
think
anon
it
lives
leontes
o
sweet
paulina
make
me
to
think
so
twenty
years
together
no
settled
senses
of
the
world
can
match
the
pleasure
of
that
madness
let
t
alone
paulina
i
am
sorry
sir
i
have
thus
far
stirr
d
you
but
i
could
afflict
you
farther
leontes
do
paulina
for
this
affliction
has
a
taste
as
sweet
as
any
cordial
comfort
still
methinks
there
is
an
air
comes
from
her
what
fine
chisel
could
ever
yet
cut
breath
let
no
man
mock
me
for
i
will
kiss
her
paulina
good
my
lord
forbear
the
ruddiness
upon
her
lip
is
wet
you
ll
mar
it
if
you
kiss
it
stain
your
own
with
oily
painting
shall
i
draw
the
curtain
leontes
no
not
these
twenty
years
perdita
so
long
could
i
stand
by
a
looker
on
paulina
either
forbear
quit
presently
the
chapel
or
resolve
you
for
more
amazement
if
you
can
behold
it
i
ll
make
the
statue
move
indeed
descend
and
take
you
by
the
hand
but
then
you
ll
think
which
i
protest
against
i
am
assisted
by
wicked
powers
leontes
what
you
can
make
her
do
i
am
content
to
look
on
what
to
speak
i
am
content
to
hear
for
tis
as
easy
to
make
her
speak
as
move
paulina
it
is
required
you
do
awake
your
faith
then
all
stand
still
on
those
that
think
it
is
unlawful
business
i
am
about
let
them
depart
leontes
proceed
no
foot
shall
stir
paulina

awake
her
strike

tis
time
descend
be
stone
no
more
approach

all
that
look
upon
with
marvel

fill
your
grave
up

to
death
your
numbness
for
from
him

actions

be
holy
as
you
hear
my
spell
is
lawful
do
not
shun
her
until
you

her
die
again
for
then
you
kill
her
double

about
his
