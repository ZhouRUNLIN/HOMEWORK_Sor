the
life
and
death
of
richard
the
third
act
i
scene
i
london
a
street
enter
gloucester
solus
gloucester
now
is
the
winter
of
our
discontent
made
glorious
summer
by
this
sun
of
york
and
all
the
clouds
that
lour
d
upon
our
house
in
the
deep
bosom
of
the
ocean
buried
now
are
our
brows
bound
with
victorious
wreaths
our
bruised
arms
hung
up
for
monuments
our
stern
alarums
changed
to
merry
meetings
our
dreadful
marches
to
delightful
measures
grim
visaged
war
hath
smooth
d
his
wrinkled
front
and
now
instead
of
mounting
barded
steeds
to
fright
the
souls
of
fearful
adversaries
he
capers
nimbly
in
a
lady
s
chamber
to
the
lascivious
pleasing
of
a
lute
but
i
that
am
not
shaped
for
sportive
tricks
nor
made
to
court
an
amorous
looking
glass
i
that
am
rudely
stamp
d
and
want
love
s
majesty
to
strut
before
a
wanton
ambling
nymph
i
that
am
curtail
d
of
this
fair
proportion
cheated
of
feature
by
dissembling
nature
deformed
unfinish
d
sent
before
my
time
into
this
breathing
world
scarce
half
made
up
and
that
so
lamely
and
unfashionable
that
dogs
bark
at
me
as
i
halt
by
them
why
i
in
this
weak
piping
time
of
peace
have
no
delight
to
pass
away
the
time
unless
to
spy
my
shadow
in
the
sun
and
descant
on
mine
own
deformity
and
therefore
since
i
cannot
prove
a
lover
to
entertain
these
fair
well
spoken
days
i
am
determined
to
prove
a
villain
and
hate
the
idle
pleasures
of
these
days
plots
have
i
laid
inductions
dangerous
by
drunken
prophecies
libels
and
dreams
to
set
my
brother
clarence
and
the
king
in
deadly
hate
the
one
against
the
other
and
if
king
edward
be
as
true
and
just
as
i
am
subtle
false
and
treacherous
this
day
should
clarence
closely
be
mew
d
up
about
a
prophecy
which
says
that
g
of
edward
s
heirs
the
murderer
shall
be
dive
thoughts
down
to
my
soul
here
clarence
comes
enter
clarence
guarded
and
brakenbury
brother
good
day
what
means
this
armed
guard
that
waits
upon
your
grace
clarence
his
majesty
tendering
my
person
s
safety
hath
appointed
this
conduct
to
convey
me
to
the
tower
gloucester
upon
what
cause
clarence
because
my
name
is
george
gloucester
alack
my
lord
that
fault
is
none
of
yours
he
should
for
that
commit
your
godfathers
o
belike
his
majesty
hath
some
intent
that
you
shall
be
new
christen
d
in
the
tower
but
what
s
the
matter
clarence
may
i
know
clarence
yea
richard
when
i
know
for
i
protest
as
yet
i
do
not
but
as
i
can
learn
he
hearkens
after
prophecies
and
dreams
and
from
the
cross
row
plucks
the
letter
g
and
says
a
wizard
told
him
that
by
g
his
issue
disinherited
should
be
and
for
my
name
of
george
begins
with
g
it
follows
in
his
thought
that
i
am
he
these
as
i
learn
and
such
like
toys
as
these
have
moved
his
highness
to
commit
me
now
gloucester
why
this
it
is
when
men
are
ruled
by
women
tis
not
the
king
that
sends
you
to
the
tower
my
lady
grey
his
wife
clarence
tis
she
that
tempers
him
to
this
extremity
was
it
not
she
and
that
good
man
of
worship
anthony
woodville
her
brother
there
that
made
him
send
lord
hastings
to
the
tower
from
whence
this
present
day

we
are
not
safe

we
are
not
safe

by
heaven
i
think
there
s
no
man
is
secure
but
the
queen
s
kindred
and
night
walking
heralds
that
trudge
betwixt
the
king
and
mistress
shore
heard
ye
not
what
an
humble
suppliant
lord
hastings
was
to
her
for
his
delivery
gloucester
humbly
complaining
to
her
deity
got
my
lord
chamberlain
his
liberty
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
our
way
if
we
will
keep
in
favour
with
the
king
to
be
her
men
and
wear
her
livery
the
jealous
o
erworn
widow
and
herself
since
that
our
brother
dubb
d
them
gentlewomen
are
mighty
gossips
in
this
monarchy
brakenbury
i
beseech
your
graces
both
to
pardon
me
his
majesty
hath
straitly
given
in
charge
that
no
man
shall
have
private
conference
of
what
degree
soever
with
his
brother
gloucester
even
so
an
t
please
your
worship
brakenbury
you
may
partake
of
any
thing
we
say
we
speak
no
treason
man
we
say
the
king
is
wise
and
virtuous
and
his
noble
queen
well
struck
in
years
fair
and
not
jealous
we
say
that
shore
s
wife
hath
a
pretty
foot
a
cherry
lip
a
bonny
eye
a
passing
pleasing
tongue
and
that
the
queen
s
kindred
are
made
gentle
folks
how
say
you
sir
can
you
deny
all
this
brakenbury
with
this
my
lord
myself
have
nought
to
do
gloucester
naught
to
do
with
mistress
shore
i
tell

excepting
one

it
secretly
alone

what
one
my
lord

thou
betray
me

pardon
me

your
conference
with
the
noble
duke

what
though

her

husband
and
her
father
the
which

not
all
so
much
for

but
gentle
lady
anne
to
leave
this
keen
encounter
of

somewhat
into
a
slower
method

not
the
causer
of
the
timeless
deaths
of
these
plantagenets
henry

edward
as
blameful
as
the
executioner
lady
anne
thou
art
the
cause
and
most
accursed
effect
gloucester
your
beauty
was
the
cause
of
that
effect
your
beauty
which
did
haunt
me
in
my
sleep
to
undertake
the
death
of
all
the
world
so
i
might
live
one
hour
in

never
endure

for
thy
sake
gloucester
never
came
poison
from
so
sweet
a
place
lady
anne
never
hung
poison
on
a
fouler
toad
out
of
my
sight
thou
dost
infect
my
eyes
gloucester
thine
eyes
sweet
lady
have
infected
mine
lady
anne
would
they
were
basilisks
to
strike
thee
dead
gloucester
i
would
they
were
that
i
might
die
at
once
for
now
they
kill
me
with
a
living
death
those
eyes
of
thine
from
mine
have
drawn
salt
tears
shamed
their
aspect
with
store
of
childish
drops
these
eyes
that
never
shed
remorseful
tear
no
when
my
father
york
and
edward
wept
to
hear
the
piteous
moan
that
rutland
made
when
black
faced
clifford
shook
his
sword
at
him
nor
when
thy
warlike
father
like
a
child
told
the
sad
story
of
my
father
s
death
and
twenty
times
made
pause
to
sob
and
weep
that
all
the
standers
by
had
wet
their
cheeks
like
trees
bedash
d
with
rain
in
that
sad
time
my
manly
eyes
did
scorn
an
humble
tear
and
what
these
sorrows
could
not
thence
exhale
thy
beauty
hath
and
made
them
blind
with
weeping
i
never
sued
to
friend
nor
enemy
my
tongue
could
never
learn
sweet
smoothing
word
but
now
thy
beauty
is
proposed
my
fee
my
proud
heart
sues
and
prompts
my
tongue
to
speak
she
looks
scornfully
at
him
teach
not
thy
lips
such
scorn
for
they
were
made
for
kissing
lady
not
for
such
contempt
if
thy
revengeful
heart
cannot
forgive
lo
here
i
lend
thee
this
sharp
pointed
sword
which
if
thou
please
to
hide
in
this
true
bosom
and
let
the
soul
forth
that
adoreth
thee
i
lay
it
naked
to
the
deadly
stroke
and
humbly
beg
the
death
upon
my
knee
he
lays
his
breast
open
she
offers
at
it
with
his
sword
nay
do
not
pause
for
i
did
kill
king
henry
but
twas
thy
beauty
that
provoked
me
nay

thereof
that
i
have
done
to
her
queen

i
never
did
her
any
to
my
knowledge
gloucester
but
you
have
all
the
vantage
of
her
wrong
i
was
too
hot
to
do
somebody
good
that
is
too
cold
in
thinking
of
it

simple
gulls

the

against

brother
now
they
believe
it
and
withal
whet
me
to
be
revenged
on

grey
but
then
i
sigh
and
with
a
piece
of
scripture
tell
them
that
god
bids
us
do
good
for
evil
and
thus
i
clothe
my
naked
villany
with
old
odd
ends
stolen
out
of
holy
writ
and
seem
a
saint
when

so
heavily
today

o
i
have
pass
d
a
miserable
night
so
full
of
ugly
sights
of
ghastly
dreams
that
as
i
am
a
christian
faithful
man
i
would
not
spend
another
such
a
night
though
twere
to
buy
a
world
of
happy
days
so
full
of
dismal
terror
was
the
time
brakenbury
what
was
your
dream
i
long
to
hear
you
tell
it
clarence
methoughts
that
i
had
broken
from
the
tower
and
was
embark
d
to
cross
to
burgundy
and
in
my
company
my
brother
gloucester
who
from
my
cabin
tempted
me
to
walk
upon
the
hatches
thence
we
looked
toward
england
and
cited
up
a
thousand
fearful
times
during
the
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
that
had
befall
n
us
as
we
paced
along
upon
the
giddy
footing
of
the
hatches
methought
that
gloucester
stumbled
and
in
falling
struck
me
that
thought
to
stay
him
overboard
into
the
tumbling
billows
of
the
main
lord
lord
methought
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
what
dreadful
noise
of
waters
in
mine
ears
what
ugly
sights
of
death
within
mine
eyes
methought
i
saw
a
thousand
fearful
wrecks
ten
thousand
men
that
fishes
gnaw
d
upon
wedges
of
gold
great
anchors
heaps
of
pearl
inestimable
stones
unvalued
jewels
all
scatter
d
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
some
lay
in
dead
men
s
skulls
and
in
those
holes
where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
there
were
crept
as
twere
in
scorn
of
eyes
reflecting
gems
which
woo
d
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
deep
and
mock
d
the
dead
bones
that
lay
scatter
d
by
brakenbury
had
you
such
leisure
in
the
time
of
death
to
gaze
upon
the
secrets
of
the
deep
clarence
methought
i
had
and
often
did
i
strive
to
yield
the
ghost
but
still
the
envious
flood
kept
in
my
soul
and
would
not
let
it
forth
to
seek
the
empty
vast
and
wandering
air
but
smother
d
it
within
my
panting
bulk
which
almost
burst
to
belch
it
in
the
sea
brakenbury
awaked
you
not
with
this
sore
agony
clarence
o
no
my
dream
was
lengthen
d
after
life
o
then
began
the
tempest
to
my
soul
who
pass
d
methought
the
melancholy
flood
with
that
grim
ferryman
which
poets
write
of
unto
the
kingdom
of
perpetual
night
the
first
that
there
did
greet
my
stranger
soul
was
my
great
father
in
law
renowned
warwick
who
cried
aloud
what
scourge
for
perjury
can
this
dark
monarchy
afford
false
clarence
and
so
he
vanish
d
then
came
wandering
by
a
shadow
like
an
angel
with
bright
hair
dabbled
in
blood
and
he
squeak
d
out
aloud
clarence
is
come
false
fleeting
perjured
clarence
that
stabb
d
me
in
the
field
by
tewksbury
seize
on
him
furies
take
him
to
your
torments
with
that
methoughts
a
legion
of
foul
fiends
environ
d
me
about
and
howled
in
mine
ears
such
hideous
cries
that
with
the
very
noise
i
trembling
waked
and
for
a
season
after
could
not
believe
but
that
i
was
in
hell
such
terrible
impression
made
the
dream
brakenbury
no
marvel
my
lord
though
it
affrighted
you
i
promise
i
am
afraid
to
hear
you
tell
it
clarence
o
brakenbury
i
have
done
those
things
which
now
bear
evidence
against
my
soul
for
edward
s
sake
and
see
how
he
requites
me
o
god
if
my
deep
prayers
cannot
appease
thee
but
thou
wilt
be
avenged
on
my
misdeeds
yet
execute
thy
wrath
in
me
alone
o
spare
my
guiltless
wife
and
my
poor
children
i
pray
thee
gentle
keeper
stay
by
me
my
soul
is
heavy
and
i
fain
would
sleep
brakenbury
i
will
my
lord
god
give
your
grace
good
rest
clarence
sleeps
sorrow
breaks
seasons
and
reposing
hours
makes
the
night
morning
and
the
noon
tide
night
princes
have
but
their
tides
for
their
glories
an
outward
honour
for
an
inward
toil
and
for
unfelt
imagination
they
often
feel
a
world
of
restless
cares
so
that
betwixt
their
tides
and
low
names
there
s
nothing
differs
but
the
outward
fame
enter
the
two
murderers
first
murderer
ho
who
s
here
brakenbury
in
god
s
name
what
are
you
and
how
came
you
hither
first
murderer
i
would
speak
with
clarence
and
i
came
hither
on
my
legs
brakenbury
yea
are
you
so
brief
second
murderer
o
sir
it
is
better
to
be
brief
than
tedious
show
him
our
commission
talk
no
more
brakenbury
reads
it
brakenbury
i
am
in
this
commanded
to
deliver
the
noble
duke
of
clarence
to
your
hands
i
will
not
reason
what
is
meant
hereby
because
i
will
be
guiltless
of
the
meaning
here
are
the
keys
there
sits
the
duke
asleep
i
ll
to
the
king
and
signify
to
him
that
thus
i
have
resign
d
my
charge
to
you
first
murderer
do
so
it
is
a
point
of
wisdom
fare
you
well
exit
brakenbury
second
murderer
what
shall
we
stab
him
as
he
sleeps
first
murderer
no
then
he
will
say
twas
done
cowardly
when
he
wakes
second
murderer
when
he
wakes
why
fool
he
shall
never
wake
till
the
judgment
day
first
murderer
why
then
he
will
say
we
stabbed
him
sleeping
second
murderer
the
urging
of
that
word
judgment
hath
bred
a
kind
of
remorse
in
me
first
murderer
what
art
thou
afraid
second
murderer
not
to
kill
him
having
a
warrant
for
it
but
to
be
damned
for
killing
him
from
which
no
warrant
can
defend
us
first
murderer
i
thought
thou
hadst
been
resolute
second
murderer
so
i
am
to
let
him
live
first
murderer
back
to
the
duke
of
gloucester
tell
him
so
second
murderer
i
pray
thee
stay
a
while
i
hope
my
holy
humour
will
change
twas
wont
to
hold
me
but
while
one
would
tell
twenty
first
murderer
how
dost
thou
feel
thyself
now
second
murderer
faith
some
certain
dregs
of
conscience
are
yet
within
me
first
murderer
remember
our
reward
when
the
deed
is
done
second
murderer
zounds
he
dies
i
had
forgot
the
reward
first
murderer
where
is
thy
conscience
now
second
murderer
in
the
duke
of
gloucester
s
purse
first
murderer
so
when
he
opens
his
purse
to
give
us
our
reward
thy
conscience
flies
out
second
murderer
let
it
go
there
s
few
or
none
will
entertain
it
first
murderer
how
if
it
come
to
thee
again
second
murderer
i
ll
not
meddle
with
it
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
it
makes
a
man
a
coward
a
man
cannot
steal
but
it
accuseth
him
he
cannot
swear
but
it
cheques
him
he
cannot
lie
with
his
neighbour
s
wife
but
it
detects
him
tis
a
blushing
shamefast
spirit
that
mutinies
in
a
man
s
bosom
it
fills
one
full
of
obstacles
it
made
me
once
restore
a
purse
of
gold
that
i
found
it
beggars
any
man
that
keeps
it
it
is
turned
out
of
all
towns
and
cities
for
a

marvel
why

out

sorrowing
peers
that
bear
this
mutual
heavy
load
of

in
each
other
s
love
though
we
have
spent
our
harvest
of
this
king
we
are
to
reap
the
harvest
of
his
son
the
broken
rancour
of
your
high
swoln
hearts
but
lately
splinter
d
knit
and
join
d
together
must
gently
be
preserved
cherish
d
and
kept
me
seemeth
good
that
with
some
little
train
forthwith
from
ludlow
the
young
prince
be
fetch
d
hither
to
london
to
be
crown
d
our
king
rivers
why
with
some
little
train
my
lord
of
buckingham
buckingham
marry
my
lord
lest
by
a
multitude
the
new
heal
d
wound
of
malice
should
break
out
which
would
be
so
much
the
more
dangerous
by
how
much
the
estate
is
green
and
yet
ungovern
d
where
every
horse
bears
his
commanding
rein
and
may
direct
his
course
as
please
himself
as
well
the
fear
of
harm
as
harm
apparent
in
my
opinion
ought
to
be
prevented
gloucester
i
hope
the
king
made
peace
with
all
of
us
and
the
compact
is
firm
and
true
in
me
rivers
and
so
in
me
and
so
i
think
in
all
yet
since
it
is
but
green
it
should
be
put
to
no
apparent
likelihood
of
breach
which
haply
by
much
company
might
be
urged
therefore
i
say
with
noble
buckingham
that
it
is
meet
so
few
should
fetch
the
prince
hastings
and
so
say
i
gloucester
then
be
it
so
and
go
we
to
determine
who
they
shall
be
that
straight
shall
post
to
ludlow

you

that

neighbours
god
speed

give
you
good
morrow
sir
third
citizen
doth
this
news
hold
of
good
king
edward
s
death
second
citizen
ay
sir
it
is
too
true
god
help
the
while
third
citizen
then
masters
look
to
see
a
troublous
world
first
citizen
no
no
by
god
s
good
grace
his
son
shall
reign
third
citizen
woe
to
the
land
that
s
govern
d
by
a
child
second
citizen
in
him
there
is
a
hope
of
government
that
in
his
nonage
council
under
him
and
in
his
full
and
ripen
d
years
himself
no
doubt
shall
then
and
till
then
govern
well
first
citizen
so
stood
the
state
when
henry
the
sixth
was
crown
d
in
paris
but
at
nine
months
old
third
citizen
stood
the
state
so
no
no
good
friends
god
wot
for
then
this
land
was
famously
enrich
d
with
politic
grave
counsel
then
the
king
had
virtuous
uncles
to
protect
his
grace
first
citizen
why
so
hath
this
both
by
the
father
and
mother
third
citizen
better
it
were
they
all
came
by
the
father
or
by
the
father
there
were
none
at
all
for
emulation
now
who
shall
be
nearest
will
touch
us
all
too
near
if
god
prevent
not
o
full
of
danger
is
the
duke
of
gloucester
and
the
queen
s
sons
and
brothers
haught
and
proud
and
were
they
to
be
ruled
and
not
to
rule
this
sickly
land
might
solace
as
before
first
citizen
come
come
we
fear
the
worst
all
shall
be
well
third
citizen
when
clouds
appear
wise
men
put
on
their
cloaks
when
great
leaves
fall
the
winter
is
at

when
the
sun
sets
who
doth
not
look
for
night
untimely
storms
make
men
expect
a
dearth
all
may
be
well
but
if
god
sort
it
so
tis
more
than
we
deserve
or
i
expect
second
citizen
truly
the
souls
of
men
are
full
of
dread
ye
cannot
reason
almost
with
a
man
that
looks
not
heavily
and
full
of
fear
third
citizen
before
the
times
of
change
still
is
it
so
by
a
divine
instinct
men
s
minds
mistrust
ensuing
dangers
as
by
proof
we
see
the
waters
swell
before
a
boisterous
storm
but
leave
it
all
to
god
whither
away

flowers
are
slow

make

to
send
the
duke
of
york
unto
his
princely
brother
presently
if
she
deny
lord
hastings
go
with
him
and
from
her
jealous
arms
pluck
him
perforce
cardinal
my
lord
of
buckingham
if
my
weak
oratory
can
from
his
mother
win
the
duke
of
york
anon
expect
him
here
but
if
she
be
obdurate
to
mild
entreaties
god
in
heaven
forbid
we
should
infringe
the
holy
privilege
of
blessed
sanctuary
not
for
all
this
land
would
i
be
guilty
of
so
deep
a
sin
buckingham
you
are
too
senseless
obstinate
my
lord
too
ceremonious
and
traditional
weigh
it
but
with
the
grossness
of
this
age
you
break
not
sanctuary
in
seizing
him
the
benefit
thereof
is
always
granted
to
those
whose
dealings
have
deserved
the
place
and
those
who
have
the
wit
to
claim
the
place
this
prince
hath
neither
claim
d
it
nor
deserved
it
and
therefore
in
mine
opinion
cannot
have
it
then
taking
him
from
thence
that
is
not
there
you
break
no
privilege
nor
charter
there
oft
have
i
heard
of
sanctuary
men
but
sanctuary
children
ne
er
till
now
cardinal
my
lord
you
shall
o
er
rule
my
mind
for
once
come
on
lord
hastings
will
you
go
with
me
hastings
i
go
my
lord
prince
edward
good
lords
make
all
the
speedy
haste
you
may
exeunt
cardinal
and
hastings
say
uncle
gloucester
if
our
brother
come
where
shall
we
sojourn
till
our
coronation
gloucester
where
it
seems
best
unto
your
royal
self
if
i
may
counsel
you
some
day
or
two
your
highness
shall
repose
you
at
the
tower
then
where
you
please
and
shall
be
thought
most
fit
for
your
best
health
and
recreation
prince
edward
i
do
not
like
the
tower
of
any
place
did
julius
caesar
build
that
place
my
lord
buckingham
he
did
my
gracious
lord
begin
that
place
which
since
succeeding
ages
have
re
edified
prince
edward
is
it
upon
record
or
else
reported
successively
from
age
to
age
he
built
it
buckingham
upon
record
my
gracious
lord
prince
edward
but
say
my
lord
it
were
not
register
d
methinks
the
truth
should
live
from
age
to
age
as
twere
retail
d
to
all
posterity
even
to
the
general
all
ending
day
gloucester
[aside]
so
wise
so
young
they
say
do
never
live
long
prince
edward
what
say
you
uncle
gloucester
i
say
without
characters
fame
lives
long
aside
thus
like
the
formal
vice
iniquity
i
moralize
two
meanings
in
one
word
prince
edward
that
julius
caesar
was
a
famous
man
with
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit
his
wit
set
down
to
make
his
valour
live
death
makes
no
conquest
of
this
conqueror
for
now
he
lives
in
fame
though
not
in
life
i
ll
tell
you
what
my
cousin
buckingham
buckingham
what
my
gracious
lord
prince
edward
an
if
i
live
until
i
be
a
man
i
ll
win
our
ancient
right
in
france
again
or
die
a
soldier
as
i
lived
a
king
gloucester
[aside]
short
summers
lightly
have
a
forward
spring
enter
young
york
hastings
and
the
cardinal
buckingham
now
in
good
time
here
comes
the
duke
of
york
prince
edward
richard
of
york
how
fares
our
loving
brother
york
well
my
dread
lord
so
must
i
call
you
now
prince
edward
ay
brother
to
our
grief
as
it
is
yours
too
late
he
died
that
might
have
kept
that
title
which
by
his
death
hath
lost
much
majesty
gloucester
how
fares
our
cousin
noble
lord
of
york
york
i
thank
you
gentle
uncle
o
my
lord
you
said
that
idle
weeds
are
fast
in
growth
the
prince
my
brother
hath
outgrown
me
far
gloucester
he
hath
my
lord
york
and
therefore
is
he
idle
gloucester
o
my
fair
cousin
i
must
not
say
so
york
then
is
he
more
beholding
to
you
than
i
gloucester
he
may
command
me
as
my
sovereign
but
you
have
power
in
me
as
in
a
kinsman
york
i
pray
you
uncle
give
me
this
dagger
gloucester
my
dagger
little
cousin
with
all
my
heart
prince
edward
a
beggar
brother
york
of
my
kind
uncle
that
i
know
will
give
and
being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to
give
gloucester
a
greater
gift
than
that
i
ll
give
my
cousin
york
a
greater
gift
o
that
s
the
sword
to
it
gloucester
a
gentle
cousin
were
it
light
enough
york
o
then
i
see
you
will
part
but
with
light
gifts
in
weightier
things
you
ll
say
a
beggar
nay
gloucester
it
is
too
heavy
for
your
grace
to
wear
york
i
weigh
it
lightly
were
it
heavier
gloucester
what
would
you
have
my
weapon
little
lord
york
i
would
that
i
might
thank
you
as
you
call
me
gloucester
how
york
little
prince
edward
my
lord
of
york
will
still
be
cross
in
talk
uncle
your
grace
knows
how
to
bear
with
him
york
you
mean
to
bear
me
not
to
bear
with
me
uncle
my
brother
mocks
both
you
and
me
because
that
i
am
little
like
an
ape
he
thinks
that
you
should
bear
me
on
your
shoulders
buckingham
with
what
a
sharp
provided
wit
he
reasons
to
mitigate
the
scorn
he
gives
his
uncle
he
prettily
and
aptly
taunts
himself
so
cunning
and
so
young
is
wonderful
gloucester
my
lord
will
t
please
you
pass
along
myself
and
my
good
cousin
buckingham

to
your

upon
the
stroke
of
four
hastings
cannot
thy
master
sleep
these
tedious
nights
messenger
so
it
should
seem
by
that
i
have
to
say
first
he
commends
him
to
your
noble
lordship
hastings
and
then
messenger
and
then
he
sends
you
word
he
dreamt
to
night
the
boar
had
razed
his
helm
besides
he
says
there
are
two
councils
held
and
that
may
be
determined
at
the
one
which
may
make
you
and
him
to
rue
at

sends
to

pleasure
if
presently
you
will
take

with

and
with

my
servant
catesby
where
nothing
can
proceed
that
toucheth
us
whereof
i
shall
not
have
intelligence
tell
him
his
fears
are
shallow
wanting
instance
and
for
his
dreams
i
wonder
he
is
so
fond
to
trust
the
mockery
of
unquiet
slumbers
to
fly
the
boar
before
the
boar
pursues
were
to
incense
the
boar
to
follow
us
and
make
pursuit
where
he
did
mean
no
chase
go
bid
thy
master
rise
and
come
to
me
and

both
together

crown
of
mine
cut
from

canst
thou
guess
that
he
doth
aim
at
it
catesby
ay
on
my
life
and
hopes
to
find
forward
upon
his
party
for
the
gain
thereof

this
good
news
that
this
same
very
day

kindred
of
the
queen
must
die

at

should
die
until
your
lordship
came
to
see
his
death
which
now
the
loving
haste
of
these
our
friends
somewhat
against
our
meaning
have
prevented
because
my
lord
we
would
have
had
you
heard
the
traitor
speak
and
timorously
confess
the
manner
and
the
purpose
of
his
treason
that
you
might
well
have
signified
the
same
unto
the
citizens
who
haply
may
misconstrue
us
in
him
and
wail
his
death
lord
mayor
but
my
good
lord
your
grace
s
word
shall
serve
as
well
as
i
had
seen
and
heard
him
speak
and
doubt
you
not
right
noble
princes
both
but
i
ll
acquaint
our
duteous
citizens
with
all
your
just
proceedings
in

to
that
end
we
wish
d
your
lord

to
avoid
the
carping
censures
of
the
world
buckingham
but
since
you
come
too
late
of
our
intents
yet
witness
what
you
hear
we
did
intend

so
my

indeed
his

by
the

thereof
was
termed

moreover
urge
his
hateful

bestial
appetite
in

of

which
stretched
to
their

by

that
the

not
his
begot

well
appeared
in
his

nothing

they
spake
not

like
dumb
statues
or
breathing
stones
gazed
each
on
other
and
look
d
deadly
pale
which
when
i
saw
i
reprehended
them
and
ask
d
the
mayor
what
meant
this
wilful
silence
his
answer
was
the
people
were
not
wont
to
be
spoke
to
but
by
the
recorder
then
he
was
urged
to
tell
my
tale
again
thus
saith
the
duke
thus
hath
the
duke
inferr
d
but
nothing
spake
in

from
himself

he
had
done
some
followers
of
mine
own
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
hurl
d
up
their
caps
and
some
ten
voices
cried
god

thus
i
took
the
vantage
of
those
few
thanks
gentle
citizens
and
friends
quoth
i
this
general
applause
and
loving
shout
argues
your
wisdoms
and
your

lewd
day

but
on
his
knees
at
meditation
not
dallying
with
a
brace
of
courtezans
but
meditating
with
two
deep
divines
not
sleeping
to

his
idle
body
but
praying
to
enrich
his
watchful
soul
happy
were
england

this
gracious

my
lord

wonders
to

to

with
him
his
grace
not

d
thereof
before
my
lord
he
fears
you
mean
no
good
to

that

mean
no

once

returns
lord
mayor
see
where
he
stands
between
two
clergymen
buckingham
two
props
of
virtue
for
a
christian
prince
to
stay
him
from
the
fall
of
vanity
and
see
a
book
of
prayer
in
his
hand
true
ornaments
to
know
a
holy
man
famous
plantagenet
most
gracious
prince
lend
favourable
ears
to

pardon
us
the
interruption
of
thy
devotion
and
right
christian
zeal
gloucester
my
lord
there
needs
no
such
apology
i
rather
do
beseech
you
pardon
me
who

in
the
service
of
my
god
neglect
the
visitation
of
my
friends
but
leaving

what
is
your

pleasure

even
that
i
hope
which
pleaseth
god
above
and
all
good
men
of
this
ungovern
d
isle
gloucester
i
do
suspect
i
have
done
some
offence
that
seems
disgracious
in
the
city
s
eyes
and
that
you
come
to
reprehend
my
ignorance
buckingham
you
have
my
lord
would
it
might
please
your
grace
at
our
entreaties
to
amend
that
fault
gloucester
else
wherefore
breathe
i
in
a
christian
land
buckingham
then
know
it
is
your
fault
that
you
resign
the
supreme
seat
the
throne
majestical
the
scepter
d
office
of
your
ancestors
your
state
of
fortune
and
your
due
of
birth
the
lineal
glory
of
your
royal
house
to
the
corruption
of
a
blemished
stock
whilst
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
which
here
we
waken
to
our
country
s
good
this
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
her
face
defaced
with
scars
of
infamy
her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
and
almost
shoulder
d
in
the
swallowing
gulf
of
blind
forgetfulness
and
dark
oblivion
which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
and
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
not
as
protector
steward
substitute
or
lowly
factor
for
another
s
gain
but
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
for
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
and
by
their
vehement
instigation
in
this
just
suit
come
i
to
move
your
grace
gloucester
i
know
not
whether
to
depart
in
silence
or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
if
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
tongue
tied
ambition
not
replying
yielded
to
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovereignty
which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
if
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
so
season
d
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
then
on
the
other
side
i
cheque
d
my
friends
therefore
to
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
and
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
definitively
thus
i
answer
you
your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
first
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
and
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
as
my
ripe
revenue
and
due
by
birth
yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
so
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
as
i
had
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
and
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smother
d
but
god
be
thank
d
there
s
no
need
of
me
and
much
i
need
to
help
you
if
need
were
the
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
which
mellow
d
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
and
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
on
him
i
lay
what
you
would
lay
on
me
the
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
which
god
defend
that
i
should
wring
from
him
buckingham
my
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
grace
but
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
all
circumstances
well
considered
you
say
that
edward
is
your
brother
s
son
so
say
we
too
but
not
by
edward
s
wife
for
first
he
was
contract
to
lady
lucy
your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
that
vow
and
afterward
by
substitute
betroth
d
to
bona
sister
to
the
king
of
france
these
both
put
by
a
poor
petitioner
a
care
crazed
mother
of
a
many
children
a
beauty
waning
and
distressed
widow
even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
lustful
eye
seduced
the
pitch
and
height
of
all
his
thoughts
to
base
declension
and
loathed
bigamy
by
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
this
edward
whom
our
manners
term
the
prince
more
bitterly
could
i
expostulate
save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
i
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
this
proffer
d
benefit
of
dignity
if
non
to
bless
us
and
the

withal
yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble

we
know
your
tenderness
of

and
gentle
kind
effeminate
remorse
which
we
have
noted
in
you
to
your
kin

egally
indeed
to
all
estates
yet
whether
you
accept
our
suit

no
your
brother

never
reign

king
but
we
will
plant
some
other
in

will

must
have
patience
to
endure
the
load
