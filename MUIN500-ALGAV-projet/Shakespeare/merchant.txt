the
merchant
of
venice
act
i
scene
i
venice
a
street
enter
antonio
salarino
and
salanio
antonio
in
sooth
i
know
not
why
i
am
so
sad
it
wearies
me
you
say
it
wearies
you
but
how
i
caught
it
found
it
or
came
by
it
what
stuff
tis
made
of
whereof
it
is
born
i
am
to
learn
and
such
a
want
wit
sadness
makes
of
me
that
i
have
much
ado
to
know
myself
salarino
your
mind
is
tossing
on
the
ocean
there
where
your
argosies
with
portly
sail
like
signiors
and
rich
burghers
on
the
flood
or
as
it
were
the
pageants
of
the
sea
do
overpeer
the
petty
traffickers
that
curtsy
to
them
do
them
reverence
as
they
fly
by
them
with
their
woven
wings
salanio
believe
me
sir
had
i
such
venture
forth
the
better
part
of
my
affections
would
be
with
my
hopes
abroad
i
should
be
still
plucking
the
grass
to
know
where
sits
the
wind
peering
in
maps
for
ports
and
piers
and
roads
and
every
object
that
might
make
me
fear
misfortune
to
my
ventures
out
of
doubt
would
make
me
sad
salarino
my
wind
cooling
my
broth
would
blow
me
to
an
ague
when
i
thought
what
harm
a
wind
too
great
at
sea
might
do
i
should
not
see
the
sandy
hour
glass
run
but
i
should
think
of
shallows
and
of
flats
and
see
my
wealthy
andrew
dock
d
in
sand
vailing
her
high
top
lower
than
her
ribs
to
kiss
her
burial
should
i
go
to
church
and
see
the
holy
edifice
of
stone
and
not
bethink
me
straight
of
dangerous
rocks
which
touching
but
my
gentle
vessel
s
side
would
scatter
all
her
spices
on
the
stream
enrobe
the
roaring
waters
with
my
silks
and
in
a
word
but
even
now
worth
this
and
now
worth
nothing
shall
i
have
the
thought
to
think
on
this
and
shall
i
lack
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
bechanced
would
make
me
sad
but
tell
not
me
i
know
antonio
is
sad
to
think
upon
his
merchandise
antonio
believe
me
no
i
thank
my
fortune
for
it
my
ventures
are
not
in
one
bottom
trusted
nor
to
one
place
nor
is
my
whole
estate
upon
the
fortune
of
this
present
year
therefore
my
merchandise
makes
me
not
sad
salarino
why
then
you
are
in
love
antonio
fie
fie
salarino
not
in
love
neither
then
let
us
say
you
are
sad
because
you
are
not
merry
and
twere
as
easy
for
you
to
laugh
and
leap
and
say
you
are
merry
because
you
are
not
sad
now
by
two
headed
janus
nature
hath
framed
strange
fellows
in
her
time
some
that
will
evermore
peep
through
their
eyes
and
laugh
like
parrots
at
a
bag
piper
and
other
of
such
vinegar
aspect
that
they
ll
not
show
their
teeth
in
way
of
smile
though
nestor
swear
the
jest
be
laughable
enter
bassanio
lorenzo
and
gratiano
salanio

comes
bassanio
your
most
noble
kinsman
gratiano
and
lorenzo

well

leave
you

with
better
company
salarino
i
would
have
stay
d
till
i
had
made
you
merry
if
worthier
friends
had
not
prevented
me
antonio
your
worth
is
very
dear
in
my
regard
i
take
it
your
own
business
calls
on
you
and
you
embrace
the
occasion
to
depart
salarino
good
morrow
my
good
lords
bassanio
good
signiors
both
when
shall
we
laugh

exceeding
strange

be
so
salarino

make
our
leisures
to
attend
on
yours
exeunt
salarino
and
salanio
lorenzo
my
lord
bassanio
since
you
have
found
antonio
we
two
will
leave
you
but
at
dinner
time
i
pray
you
have
in
mind
where
we
must
meet
bassanio
i
will
not
fail
you
gratiano
you
look
not
well
signior
antonio
you
have
too
much
respect
upon
the
world
they
lose
it
that
do
buy
it
with
much
care
believe
me
you
are
marvellously
changed
antonio
i
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
gratiano
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
gratiano
let
me
play
the
fool
with
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
come
and
let
my
liver
rather
heat
with
wine
than
my
heart
cool
with
mortifying
groans
why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
by
being
peevish
i
tell
thee
what
antonio
i
love
thee
and
it
is
my
love
that
speaks
there
are
a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
and
do
a
wilful
stillness
entertain
with
purpose
to
be
dress
d
in
an
opinion
of
wisdom
gravity
profound
conceit
as
who
should
say
i
am
sir
oracle
and
when
i
ope
my
lips
let
no
dog
bark
o
my
antonio
i
do
know
of
these
that
therefore
only
are
reputed
wise
for
saying
nothing
when
i
am
very
sure
if
they
should
speak
would
almost
damn
those
ears
which
hearing
them
would
call
their
brothers
fools
i
ll
tell
thee
more
of
this
another
time
but
fish
not
with
this
melancholy
bait
for
this
fool
gudgeon
this
opinion
come
good
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
awhile
i
ll
end
my
exhortation
after
dinner
lorenzo
well
we
will
leave
you
then
till
dinner
time
i
must
be
one
of
these
same
dumb
wise
men
for
gratiano
never
lets
me
speak
gratiano
well
keep
me
company
but
two
years
moe
thou
shalt
not
know
the
sound
of
thine
own
tongue
antonio
farewell
i
ll
grow
a
talker
for
this
gear
gratiano
thanks
i
faith
for
silence
is
only
commendable
in
a
neat
s
tongue
dried
and
a
maid
not
vendible
exeunt
gratiano
and
lorenzo
antonio
is
that
any
thing
now
bassanio
gratiano
speaks
an
infinite
deal
of
nothing
more
than
any
man
in
all
venice
his
reasons
are
as
two
grains
of
wheat
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
you
shall
seek
all
day
ere
you
find
them
and
when
you
have
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
antonio
well
tell
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
to
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
that
you
to
day
promised
to
tell
me
of
bassanio
tis
not
unknown
to
you
antonio
how
much
i
have
disabled
mine
estate
by
something
showing
a
more
swelling
port
than
my
faint
means
would
grant
continuance
nor
do
i
now
make
moan
to
be
abridged
from
such
a
noble
rate
but
my
chief
care
is
to
come
fairly
off
from
the
great
debts
wherein
my
time
something
too
prodigal
hath
left
me
gaged
to
you
antonio
i
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
love
and
from
your
love
i
have
a
warranty
to
unburden
all
my
plots
and
purposes
how
to
get
clear
of
all
the
debts
i
owe
antonio
i
pray
you
good
bassanio
let
me
know
it
and
if
it
stand
as
you
yourself
still
do
within
the
eye
of
honour
be
assured
my
purse
my
person
my
extremest
means
lie
all
unlock
d
to
your
occasions
bassanio
in
my
school
days
when
i
had
lost
one
shaft
i
shot
his
fellow
of
the
self
same
flight
the
self
same
way
with
more
advised
watch
to
find
the
other
forth
and
by
adventuring
both
i
oft
found
both
i
urge
this
childhood
proof
because
what
follows
is
pure
innocence
i
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wilful
youth
that
which
i
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
to
shoot
another
arrow
that
self
way
which
you
did
shoot
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
as
i
will
watch
the
aim
or
to
find
both
or
bring
your
latter
hazard
back
again
and
thankfully
rest
debtor
for
the
first
antonio
you
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
to
wind
about
my
love
with
circumstance
and
out
of
doubt
you
do
me
now
more
wrong
in
making
question
of
my
uttermost
than
if
you
had
made
waste
of
all
i
have
then
do
but
say
to
me
what
i
should
do
that
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
and
i
am
prest
unto
it
therefore
speak
bassanio
in
belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
fair
and
fairer
than
that
word
of
wondrous
virtues
sometimes
from
her
eyes
i
did
receive
fair
speechless
messages
her
name
is
portia
nothing
undervalued
to
cato
s
daughter
brutus
portia
nor
is
the
wide
world
ignorant
of
her
worth
for
the
four
winds
blow
in
from
every
coast
renowned
suitors
and
her
sunny
locks
hang
on
her
temples
like
a
golden
fleece
which
makes
her
seat
of
belmont
colchos
strand
and
many
jasons
come
in
quest
of
her
o
my
antonio
had
i
but
the
means
to
hold
a
rival
place
with
one
of
them
i
have
a
mind
presages
me
such
thrift
that
i
should
questionless
be
fortunate
antonio
thou
know
st
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at
sea
neither
have
i
money
nor
commodity
to
raise
a
present
sum
therefore
go
forth
try
what
my
credit
can
in
venice
do
that
shall
be
rack
d
even
to
the
uttermost
to
furnish
thee
to
belmont
to
fair
portia
go
presently
inquire
and
so
will
i
where
money
is
and
i
no
question
make
to
have
it
of
my
trust
or
for
my
sake
exeunt
scene
ii
belmont
a
room
in
portia
s
house
enter
portia
and
nerissa
portia
by
my
troth
nerissa
my
little
body
is
aweary
of
this
great
world
nerissa
you
would
be
sweet
madam
if
your
miseries
were
in
the
same
abundance
as
your
good
fortunes
are
and
yet
for
aught
i
see
they
are
as
sick
that
surfeit
with
too
much
as
they
that
starve
with
nothing
it
is
no
mean
happiness
therefore
to
be
seated
in
the
mean
superfluity
comes
sooner
by
white
hairs
but
competency
lives
longer
portia
good
sentences
and
well
pronounced
nerissa
they
would
be
better
if
well
followed
portia
if
to
do
were
as
easy
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
do
chapels
had
been
churches
and
poor
men
s
cottages
princes
palaces
it
is
a
good
divine
that
follows
his
own
instructions
i
can
easier
teach
twenty
what
were
good
to
be
done
than
be
one
of
the
twenty
to
follow
mine
own
teaching
the
brain
may
devise
laws
for
the
blood
but
a
hot
temper
leaps
o
er
a
cold
decree
such
a
hare
is
madness
the
youth
to
skip
o
er
the
meshes
of
good
counsel
the
cripple
but
this
reasoning
is
not
in
the
fashion
to
choose
me
a
husband
o
me
the
word
choose
i
may
neither
choose
whom
i
would
nor
refuse
whom
i
dislike
so
is
the
will
of
a
living
daughter
curbed
by
the
will
of
a
dead
father
is
it
not
hard
nerissa
that
i
cannot
choose
one
nor
refuse
none
nerissa
your
father
was
ever
virtuous
and
holy
men
at
their
death
have
good
inspirations
therefore
the
lottery
that
he
hath
devised
in
these
three
chests
of
gold
silver
and
lead
whereof
who
chooses
his
meaning
chooses
you
will
no
doubt
never
be
chosen
by
any
rightly
but
one
who
shall
rightly
love
but
what
warmth
is
there
in
your
affection
towards
any
of
these
princely
suitors
that
are
already
come
portia
i
pray
thee
over
name
them
and
as
thou
namest
them
i
will
describe
them
and
according
to
my
description
level
at
my
affection
nerissa
first
there
is
the
neapolitan
prince
portia
ay
that
s
a
colt
indeed
for
he
doth
nothing
but
talk
of
his
horse
and
he
makes
it
a
great
appropriation
to
his
own
good
parts
that
he
can
shoe
him
himself
i
am
much
afeard
my
lady
his
mother
played
false
with
a
smith
nerissa
then
there
is
the
county
palatine
portia
he
doth
nothing
but
frown
as
who
should
say
if
you
will
not
have
me
choose
he
hears
merry
tales
and
smiles
not
i
fear
he
will
prove
the
weeping
philosopher
when
he
grows
old
being
so
full
of
unmannerly
sadness
in
his
youth
i
had
rather
be
married
to
a
death
s
head
with
a
bone
in
his
mouth
than
to
either
of
these
god
defend
me
from
these
two
nerissa
how
say
you
by
the
french
lord
monsieur
le
bon
portia
god
made
him
and
therefore
let
him
pass
for
a
man
in
truth
i
know
it
is
a
sin
to
be
a
mocker
but
he
why
he
hath
a
horse
better
than
the
neapolitan
s
a
better
bad
habit
of
frowning
than
the
count
palatine
he
is
every
man
in
no
man
if
a
throstle
sing
he
falls
straight
a
capering
he
will
fence
with
his
own
shadow
if
i
should
marry
him
i
should
marry
twenty
husbands
if
he
would
despise
me
i
would
forgive
him
for
if
he
love
me
to
madness
i
shall
never
requite
him
nerissa
what
say
you
then
to
falconbridge
the
young
baron
of
england
portia
you
know
i
say
nothing
to
him
for
he
understands
not
me
nor
i
him
he
hath
neither
latin
french
nor
italian
and
you
will
come
into
the
court
and
swear
that
i
have
a
poor
pennyworth
in
the
english
he
is
a
proper
man
s
picture
but
alas
who
can
converse
with
a
dumb
show
how
oddly
he
is
suited
i
think
he
bought
his
doublet
in
italy
his
round
hose
in
france
his
bonnet
in
germany
and
his
behavior
every
where
nerissa
what
think
you
of
the
scottish
lord
his
neighbour
portia
that
he
hath
a
neighbourly
charity
in
him
for
he
borrowed
a
box
of
the
ear
of
the
englishman
and
swore
he
would
pay
him
again
when
he
was
able
i
think
the
frenchman
became
his
surety
and
sealed
under
for
another
nerissa
how
like
you
the
young
german
the
duke
of
saxony
s
nephew
portia
very
vilely
in
the
morning
when
he
is
sober
and
most
vilely
in
the
afternoon
when
he
is
drunk
when
he
is
best
he
is
a
little
worse
than
a
man
and
when
he
is
worst
he
is
little
better
than
a
beast
and
the
worst
fall
that
ever
fell
i
hope
i
shall
make
shift
to
go
without
him
nerissa
if
he
should
offer
to
choose
and
choose
the
right
casket
you
should
refuse
to
perform
your
father
s
will
if
you
should
refuse
to
accept
him
portia
therefore
for
fear
of
the
worst
i
pray
thee
set
a
deep
glass
of
rhenish
wine
on
the
contrary
casket
for
if
the
devil
be
within
and
that
temptation
without
i
know
he
will
choose
it
i
will
do
any
thing
nerissa
ere
i
ll
be
married
to
a
sponge
nerissa
you
need
not
fear
lady
the
having
any
of
these
lords
they
have
acquainted
me
with
their
determinations
which
is
indeed
to
return
to
their
home
and
to
trouble
you
with
no
more
suit
unless
you
may
be
won
by
some
other
sort
than
your
father
s
imposition
depending
on
the
caskets
portia
if
i
live
to
be
as
old
as
sibylla
i
will
die
as
chaste
as
diana
unless
i
be
obtained
by
the
manner
of
my
father
s
will
i
am
glad
this
parcel
of
wooers
are
so
reasonable
for
there
is
not
one
among
them
but
i
dote
on
his
very
absence
and
i
pray
god
grant
them
a
fair
departure
nerissa
do
you
not
remember
lady
in
your
father
s
time
a
venetian
a
scholar
and
a
soldier
that
came
hither
in
company
of
the
marquis
of
montferrat
portia
yes
yes
it
was
bassanio
as
i
think
he
was
so
called
nerissa
true
madam
he
of
all
the
men
that
ever
my
foolish
eyes
looked
upon
was
the
best
deserving
a
fair
lady
portia
i
remember
him
well
and
i
remember
him
worthy
of
thy
praise
enter
a
serving
man
how
now
what
news
servant
the
four
strangers
seek
for
you

shylock
oh
no
no
no
no
my
meaning
in
saying
he
is
a
good
man
is
to
have
you
understand
me
that
he
is
sufficient
yet
his
means
are
in
supposition
he
hath
an
argosy
bound
to
tripolis
another
to
the
indies
i
understand
moreover
upon
the
rialto
he
hath
a
third
at
mexico
a
fourth
for
england
and
other
ventures
he
hath
squandered
abroad

there
be
land
rats
and
water
rats
water
thieves
and

then
there
is
the
peril
of

how
like
a
fawning
publican
he
looks
i
hate
him
for
he
is
a
christian
but
more
for
that
in
low
simplicity
he
lends
out
money
gratis
and
brings
down
the
rate
of
usance
here
with
us
in
venice
if
i
can
catch
him
once
upon
the
hip
i
will
feed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
i
bear
him
he
hates
our
sacred
nation
and
he
rails
even
there
where
merchants
most
do
congregate
on
me
my
bargains
and
my
well
won
thrift
which
he
calls
interest
cursed
be
my
tribe
if
i
forgive
him

am
debating
of

my
memory

gross
of
full
three
thousand
ducats
what
of
that
tubal
a
wealthy
hebrew
of
my

when
jacob
grazed
his
uncle
laban
s
sheep
this
jacob
from
our
holy
abram
was
as
his
wise
mother
wrought
in
his

he
was
the
third
antonio

what
of
him
did
he
take
interest
shylock
no
not
take
interest
not
as
you
would
say
directly
interest
mark
what
jacob
did
when
laban
and
himself
were
compromised
that
all
the
eanlings
which
were
streak
d
and
pied
should
fall
as
jacob
s
hire
the
ewes
being
rank
in
the
end
of
autumn
turned
to
the
rams
and
when
the
work
of
generation
was
between
these
woolly
breeders
in
the
act
the
skilful
shepherd
peel
d
me
certain
wands
and
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
of
kind
he
stuck
them
up
before
the
fulsome
ewes
who
then
conceiving
did
in
eaning
time
fall
parti
colour
d
lambs
and
those
were
jacob
s
this
was
a
way
to
thrive
and
he
was
blest
and
thrift
is
blessing
if
men
steal
it
not
antonio
this
was
a
venture
sir
that
jacob
served
for
a
thing
not
in
his
power
to
bring
to
pass
but
sway
d
and
fashion
d
by
the
hand
of

that

hath
a

of
rich

wrecked
on
the
narrow

the

i
think
they
call
the
place
a
very
dangerous
flat
and
fatal
where
the
carcasses
of
many
a
tall

lie
buried

for

it
is
true
without
any

crossing

shylock
you
know
none
so

of
my

flight

that
s

i
for
my
part
knew
the
tailor
that
made
the
wings
she
flew
withal
salanio
and
shylock
for
his
own
part
knew
the
bird
was
fledged
and
then
it
is
the
complexion
of
them
all
to
leave
the

shylock
she
is
damned
for
it
salanio
that
s
certain
if
the

may
be
her

shylock
my

to
rebel
salanio
out
upon

old
carrion

shylock
i
say
my
daughter
is
my
flesh

blood
salarino
there
is
more
difference
between
thy
flesh
and
hers
than
between
jet

ivory
more
between
your

than
there
is
between
red
wine

rhenish
but
tell
us
do
you
hear
whether
antonio
have
had
any
loss
at
sea
or
no
shylock
there
i
have
another
bad

a

a

why
i

not
take
his

what
s
that
good
for

if

it

i
pray
you
tarry
pause
a
day
or
two
before
you
hazard
for
in
choosing
wrong
i
lose
your
company
therefore
forbear
awhile
there
s
something
tells
me
but
it
is
not
love
i
would
not
lose
you
and
you
know
yourself
hate
counsels
not
in
such
a
quality
but
lest
you
should
not
understand
me
well
and
yet
a
maiden
hath
no
tongue
but
thought
i
would
detain
you
here
some
month
or
two
before
you
venture
for
me
i
could
teach
you
how
to
choose
right
but
i
am
then
forsworn
so
will
i
never
be
so
may
you
miss
me
but
if
you
do
you
ll
make
me
wish
a
sin
that
i
had
been
forsworn
beshrew
your

they

one
half
of

the

half
yours
mine
own
i
would
say
but
if
mine
then
yours
and
so
all
yours
o
these
naughty
times
put
bars
between
the
owners
and
their
rights
and
so
though
yours
not
yours
prove
it
so
let
fortune
go
to
hell
for
it
not
i
i
speak
too
long
but
tis
to
peize
the
time
to
eke
it
and
to
draw
it
out
in

to
stay
you
from
election
bassanio
let
me
choose
for
as
i
am
i
live
upon
the
rack
portia
upon
the
rack
bassanio
then
confess
what
treason
there
is
mingled
with
your
love
bassanio
none
but
that
ugly
treason
of
mistrust
which
makes
me
fear
the
enjoying
of
my
love
there
may
as
well
be
amity
and
life
tween
snow
and
fire
as
treason
and
my
love
portia
ay
but
i
fear
you
speak
upon
the
rack
where
men
enforced
do
speak
anything
bassanio
promise
me
life
and
i
ll
confess
the
truth
portia
well
then
confess
and
live
bassanio
confess
and
love
had
been
the
very
sum
of
my
confession
o
happy
torment
when
my
torturer
doth
teach
me
answers
for
deliverance
but
let
me
to
my
fortune
and
the
caskets
portia
away
then
i
am
lock
d
in
one
of
them
if
you
do
love
me
you
will
find
me
out
nerissa
and
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
let
music
sound
while
he
doth
make
his
choice
then
if
he
lose
he
makes
a
swan
like
end
fading
in
music
that
the
comparison
may
stand
more
proper
my
eye
shall
be
the
stream
and
watery
death
bed
for
him
he
may
win
and
what
is
music
then
then
music
is
even
as
the
flourish
when
true
subjects
bow
to
a
new
crowned
monarch
such
it
is
as
are
those
dulcet
sounds
in
break
of
day
that
creep
into
the
dreaming
bridegroom
s
ear
and
summon
him
to
marriage
now
he
goes
with
no
less
presence
but
with
much
more
love
than
young
alcides
when
he
did
redeem
the
virgin
tribute
paid
by
howling
troy
to
the

monster
i

for

i
live
with
much
much
more

so
may

the

is
still
deceived
with
ornament
in

what
plea
so
tainted
and
corrupt
but
being
seasoned
with
a
gracious
voice
obscures
the
show
of
evil
in

what
damned
error
but
some
sober
brow
will
bless
it
and
approve
it
with
a
text
hiding
the
grossness
with
fair
ornament
there
is
no
vice
so
simple
but
assumes
some
mark
of
virtue
on
his
outward
parts
how
many
cowards
whose
hearts
are
all
as
false
as
stairs
of
sand
wear
yet
upon
their
chins
the
beards
of
hercules
and
frowning

and
these

valour
s
excrement
to
render
them
redoubted
look

you
shall

tis
purchased
by
the
weight
which
therein
works
a
miracle
in

making
them
lightest
that
wear

are
those
crisped
snaky
golden
locks
which
make
such
wanton
gambols
with
the
wind
upon
supposed
fairness
often
known
to
be
the
dowry
of
a
second

the
skull
that
bred

in

the
substance
of

praise
doth
wrong
this
shadow
in
underprizing
it
so
far
this
shadow
doth
limp
behind
the
substance
here
s
the
scroll
the
continent
and
summary
of
my
fortune
reads
you
that
choose
not
by
the
view
chance
as
fair
and
choose
as
true
since
this
fortune
falls
to
you
be
content
and
seek
no
new
if
you
be
well
pleased
with
this
and
hold
your
fortune
for
your
bliss
turn
you
where
your
lady
is
and
claim
her
with
a
loving
kiss
a
gentle
scroll
fair
lady
by
your
leave
i
come
by
note
to
give
and
to
receive
like
one
of
two
contending
in
a
prize
that
thinks
he
hath
done
well
in
people
s
eyes
hearing
applause
and
universal
shout
giddy
in
spirit
still
gazing
in
a
doubt
whether
these
pearls
of
praise
be
his
or
no
so
thrice
fair
lady
stand
i
even
so
as
doubtful
whether
what
i
see
be
true
until
confirm
d
sign
d
ratified
by
you
portia
you
see
me
lord
bassanio
where
i
stand
such
as
i
am
though
for
myself
alone
i
would
not
be
ambitious
in
my
wish
to
wish
myself
much
better
yet
for
you
i
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
a
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
that
only
to
stand
high
in
your
account
i
might
in
virtue
beauties
livings
friends
exceed
account
but
the
full
sum
of
me
is
sum
of
something
which
to
term
in
gross
is
an
unlesson
d
girl
unschool
d
unpractised
happy
in
this
she
is
not
yet
so
old
but
she
may
learn
happier
than
this
she
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learn
happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
commits
itself
to
yours
to
be
directed
as
from
her
lord
her
governor
her
king
myself
and
what
is
mine
to
you
and
yours
is
now
converted
but
now
i
was
the
lord
of
this
fair
mansion
master
of
my
servants
queen
o
er
myself
and
even
now
but
now
this
house
these
servants
and
this
same
myself
are
yours
my
lord
i
give
them
with
this
ring
which
when
you
part
from
lose
or
give
away
let
it
presage
the
ruin
of
your
love
and
be
my
vantage
to
exclaim
on
you
bassanio
madam
you
have
bereft
me
of
all
words
only
my
blood
speaks
to
you
in
my
veins
and
there
is
such
confusion
in
my
powers
as
after
some
oration
fairly
spoke
by
a
beloved
prince
there
doth
appear
among
the
buzzing
pleased
multitude
where
every
something
being
blent
together
turns
to
a
wild
of
nothing
save
of
joy
express
d
and
not
express
d
but
when
this
ring
parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
o
then
be
bold
to
say
bassanio
s
dead
nerissa
my
lord
and
lady
it
is
now
our
time
that
have
stood
by
and
seen
our
wishes
prosper
to
cry
good
joy
good
joy
my
lord
and
lady
gratiano
my
lord
bassanio
and
my
gentle
lady
i
wish
you
all
the
joy
that
you
can
wish
for
i
am
sure
you
can
wish
none
from
me
and
when
your
honours
mean
to
solemnize
the
bargain
of
your
faith
i
do
beseech
you
even
at
that
time
i
may
be
married
too
bassanio
with
all
my
heart
so
thou
canst
get
a
wife
gratiano
i
thank
your
lordship
you
have
got
me
one
my
eyes
my
lord
can
look
as
swift
as
yours
you
saw
the
mistress
i
beheld
the
maid
you
loved
i
loved
for
intermission
no
more
pertains
to
me
my
lord
than
you
your
fortune
stood
upon
the
casket
there
and
so
did
mine
too
as
the
matter
falls
for
wooing
here
until
i
sweat
again
and
sweating
until
my
very
roof
was
dry
with
oaths
of
love
at
last
if
promise
last
i
got
a
promise
of
this
fair
one
here
to
have
her
love
provided
that
your
fortune
achieved
her
mistress
portia
is
this
true
nerissa

portia
there
are
some
shrewd
contents
in
yon
same
paper
that
steals
the
colour
from
bassanio
s
cheek
some
dear
friend
dead
else
nothing
in
the
world
could
turn
so
much
the
constitution
of
any
constant
man
what
worse
and
worse
with

bassanio
i
am
half
yourself
and
i
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
bassanio
o
sweet
portia
here
are
a
few
of
the
unpleasant
st
words
that
ever
blotted
paper
gentle
lady
when
i
did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
i
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
i
had
ran
in
my
veins
i
was
a
gentleman
and
then
i
told
you
true
and
yet
dear
lady
rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
how
much
i
was
a
braggart
when
i
told
you
my
state
was
nothing
i
should
then
have
told
you
that
i
was
worse
than
nothing
for
indeed
i
have
engaged
myself
to
a
dear
friend
engaged
my
friend
to
his
mere
enemy
to
feed
my
means
here
is
a
letter
lady
the
paper
as
the
body
of
my
friend
and
every
word
in
it
a
gaping
wound
issuing
life
blood
but
is
it
true
salerio
have
all
his
ventures
fail
d
what
not
one
hit
from
tripolis
from
mexico
and
england
from
lisbon
barbary

india
and
not

scape
the
dreadful
touch
of
merchant
marring
rocks
salerio
not
one
my
lord
besides
it
should
appear
that
if
he
had
the
present
money
to
discharge
the
jew
he
would
not
take
it
never
did
i
know
a
creature
that
did
bear
the
shape
of
man
so
keen
and
greedy
to
confound
a
man
he
plies
the
duke
at
morning
and
at
night
and
doth
impeach
the
freedom
of
the
state
if
they
deny
him
justice
twenty
merchants
the
duke
himself
and
the
magnificoes
of
greatest
port
have
all
persuaded
with
him
but
none
can
drive
him
from
the
envious
plea
of
forfeiture
of
justice
and
his
bond
jessica
when
i
was
with
him
i
have
heard
him
swear
to
tubal
and
to
chus
his
countrymen
that
he
would
rather
have
antonio
s
flesh
than
twenty
times
the
value
of
the
sum
that
he
did
owe
him
and
i
know
my
lord
if
law
authority
and
power
deny
not
it
will
go

shylock
i

that
i

thou
call

before
thou
hadst
a
cause
but
since
i
am
a
dog
beware
my
fangs
the
duke
shall
grant
me
justice
i
do
wonder
thou
naughty
gaoler
that
thou
art
so
fond
to
come
abroad
with
him
at
his
request
antonio
i
pray
thee
hear
me
speak
shylock
i
ll
have
my

i
will
not
hear
thee
speak
i
ll
have
my

and
therefore
speak
no
more
i
ll
not
be
made
a
soft
and
dull

fool
to
shake
the

relent
and
sigh
and
yield
to
christian
intercessors
follow
not
i
ll
have
no

i
will
have
my

exit
salarino
it
is
the
most
impenetrable
cur
that
ever
kept
with

antonio
let
him
alone
i
ll
follow
him
no
more
with
bootless
prayers
he
seeks
my
life
his
reason
well
i
know
i
oft
deliver
d
from
his
forfeitures
many
that
have
at
times
made
moan
to
me
therefore
he
hates
me
salarino
i
am
sure
the
duke
will
never
grant
this
forfeiture
to
hold
antonio
the
duke
cannot
deny
the
course
of
law
for
the
commodity
that
strangers
have
with
us
in
venice
if
it
be
denied
will
much
impeach
the
justice
of
his
state
since
that
the
trade
and
profit
of
the
city
consisteth
of
all
nations
therefore
go
these
griefs
and
losses
have
so
bated
me
that
i
shall
hardly
spare
a
pound
of
flesh
to
morrow
to
my
bloody

nerissa
lorenzo
jessica

balthasar
lorenzo
madam
although
i
speak
it
in
your
presence
you
have
a
noble
and
a
true
conceit
of
godlike
amity
which
appears
most
strongly
in
bearing
thus
the
absence
of
your
lord
but
if
you
knew
to
whom
you
show
this
honour
how
true
a
gentleman
you
send
relief
how
dear
a
lover
of
my
lord
your
husband
i
know
you
would
be
prouder
of
the
work
than
customary
bounty
can
enforce
you
portia
i
never
did
repent
for
doing
good
nor
shall
not
now
for
in
companions
that
do
converse
and
waste
the
time
together
whose
souls
do
bear
an
equal
yoke
of
love
there
must
be
needs
a
like
proportion
of
lineaments
of
manners
and
of
spirit
which
makes
me
think
that
this
antonio
being
the
bosom
lover
of
my
lord
must
needs
be
like
my
lord
if
it
be
so
how
little
is
the
cost
i
have
bestow
d
in
purchasing
the
semblance
of
my
soul
from
out
the
state
of
hellish
misery
this
comes
too
near
the
praising
of
myself
therefore
no
more
of
it

commit
into
your
hands
the
husbandry
and

with
a
reed
voice
and
turn
two
mincing
steps
into
a
manly
stride
and
speak
of
frays
like
a
fine
bragging
youth
and
tell
quaint
lies
how
honourable
ladies
sought
my
love
which
i
denying
they
fell
sick
and
died
i
could
not

withal
then
i

discontinued

above
a
twelvemonth
i
have
within
my

a
thousand
raw
tricks
of

i
will
practise

exeunt
scene
v
the
same
a
garden
enter
launcelot
and
jessica
launcelot
yes
truly
for
look
you
the
sins
of
the
father
are
to
be
laid
upon
the
children
therefore
i
promise
ye
i
fear
you
i
was
always
plain
with
you
and
so
now
i
speak
my
agitation
of
the
matter
therefore
be
of
good
cheer
for
truly
i
think
you
are
damned
there
is
but
one
hope
in
it
that
can
do
you
any
good
and
that
is
but
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
neither
jessica
and
what
hope
is
that
i
pray
thee
launcelot
marry
you
may
partly
hope
that
your
father
got
you
not
that
you
are
not
the
jew
s
daughter
jessica
that
were
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
indeed
so
the
sins
of
my
mother
should
be
visited
upon
me
launcelot
truly
then
i
fear
you
are
damned
both
by
father
and
mother
thus
when
i
shun
scylla
your
father
i
fall
into
charybdis
your
mother
well
you
are
gone
both
ways
jessica
i
shall
be
saved
by
my
husband
he
hath
made
me
a
christian
launcelot
truly
the
more
to
blame
he
we
were
christians
enow
before
e
en
as
many
as
could
well
live
one
by
another
this
making
christians
will
raise
the
price
of
hogs
if
we
grow
all
to
be
pork
eaters
we
shall
not
shortly
have
a
rasher
on
the
coals
for
money
enter
lorenzo
jessica
i
ll
tell
my
husband
launcelot
what
you
say
here
he
comes
lorenzo
i
shall
grow
jealous
of
you
shortly
launcelot
if
you
thus
get
my
wife
into
corners
jessica
nay
you
need
not
fear
us
lorenzo
launcelot
and
i
are
out
he
tells
me
flatly
there
is
no
mercy
for
me
in
heaven
because
i
am
a
jew
s
daughter
and
he
says
you
are
no
good
member
of
the
commonwealth
for
in
converting
jews
to
christians
you
raise
the
price
of
pork
lorenzo
i
shall
answer
that
better
to
the
commonwealth
than
you
can
the
getting
up
of
the
negro
s
belly
the
moor
is
with
child
by
you
launcelot
launcelot
it
is
much
that
the
moor
should
be
more
than
reason
but
if
she
be
less
than
an
honest
woman
she
is
indeed
more
than
i
took
her
for
lorenzo
how
every
fool
can
play
upon
the
word
i
think
the
best
grace
of

am
sorry

thou
art
come
to
answer
a
stony
adversary
an
inhuman
wretch
uncapable
of

void
and
empty
from
any
dram
of
mercy
antonio
i
have
heard
your
grace
hath
ta
en
great
pains
to
qualify
his
rigorous
course
but
since
he
stands
obdurate
and
that
no
lawful
means
can
carry
me
out
of
his
envy
s
reach
i
do
oppose
my
patience
to
his
fury
and
am
arm
d
to
suffer
with
a
quietness
of
spirit
the
very
tyranny
and
rage
of
his
duke
go
one
and
call

let
him
stand
before

shylock

i
think
so
too
that
thou
but
lead
st
this
fashion
of
thy
malice
to
the
last
hour
of
act
and
then
tis
thought
thou
lt
show
thy
mercy
and
remorse
more
strange
than
is
thy
strange
apparent
cruelty
and
where
thou
now
exact
st
the
penalty
which
is
a
pound
of
this
poor
merchant
s
flesh
thou
wilt
not
only
loose
the
forfeiture
but
touch
d
with
human
gentleness
and
love
forgive
a
moiety
of
the
principal
glancing
an
eye
of
pity
on
his
losses
that
have
of
late
so
huddled
on
his
back
enow
to
press
a
royal
merchant
down
and
pluck
commiseration
of
his
state
from
brassy
bosoms
and
rough
hearts
of
flint
from
stubborn
turks
and
tartars
never
train
d
to
offices
of
tender
courtesy
we
all
expect
a
gentle
answer

danger
light
upon
your
charter
and
your
city
s
freedom
you
ll
ask
me
why
i
rather
choose
to
have
a
weight
of
carrion
flesh
than
to
receive
three
thousand
ducats
i
ll
not
answer
that
but
say
it
is
my
humour
is
it
answer
d
what
if
my
house
be
troubled
with
a
rat
and
i
be
pleased
to
give
ten
thousand
ducats
to
have
it
baned
what
are
you
answer
d
yet
some
men
there
are
love
not
a
gaping
pig
some
that
are
mad
if
they
behold
a
cat
and
others
when
the
bagpipe
sings
i
the
nose
cannot
contain
their
urine
for
affection
mistress
of
passion
sways
it
to
the
mood
of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
now
for
your
answer
as
there
is
no
firm
reason
to
be
render
d
why
he
cannot
abide
a
gaping
pig
why
he
a
harmless
necessary
cat
why
he
a
woollen
bagpipe
but
of
force
must
yield
to
such
inevitable
shame
as
to
offend
himself
being
offended
so
can
i
give
no
reason
nor
i
will
not
more
than
a
lodged
hate
and
a
certain
loathing
i
bear
antonio
that
i
follow
thus
a
losing
suit
against
him
are
you

d
bassanio

mountain
pines
to
wag

high
tops

no
noise
when

are
fretten
with

at

letter
i
am
very
sick
but
in
the
instant
that
your
messenger
came
in
loving
visitation
was
with
me
a
young
doctor
of
rome
his
name
is
balthasar
i
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
in
controversy
between
the
jew
and
antonio
the
merchant
we
turned
o
er
many
books
together
he
is
furnished
with
my
opinion
which
bettered
with
his
own
learning
the
greatness
whereof
i
cannot
enough
commend
comes
with
him
at
my
importunity
to
fill
up
your
grace
s
request
in
my
stead
i
beseech
you
let
his
lack
of
years
be
no
impediment
to
let
him
lack
a
reverend
estimation
for
i
never
knew
so
young
a
body
with
so
old
a
head
i
leave
him
to
your
gracious
acceptance
whose
trial
shall
better
publish
his
commendation
duke
you
hear
the
learn
d
bellario
what
he
writes
and
here
i
take
it
is
the
doctor
come
enter
portia
dressed
like
a
doctor
of
laws
give
me
your
hand
come
you
from
old
bellario
portia
i
did
my
lord
duke
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
portia
i
am
informed
thoroughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
the
jew
duke
antonio
and
old
shylock
both
stand
forth
portia
is
your
name
shylock
shylock
shylock
is
my
name
portia
of
a
strange
nature
is
the
suit
you
follow
yet
in
such
rule
that
the
venetian
law
cannot
impugn
you
as
you
do
proceed
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
antonio
ay
so
he
says
portia
do
you
confess
the
bond
antonio
i
do
portia
then
must
the
jew
be
merciful
shylock
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
portia
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strain
d
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blest
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
tis
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
his
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
but
mercy
is
above
this
sceptred
sway
it
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himself
and
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
god
s
when
mercy
seasons
justice
therefore
jew
though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
that
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
should
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercy
i
have
spoke
thus
much
to
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
venice
must
needs
give
sentence
gainst
the
merchant
there
shylock
my
deeds
upon
my
head
i
crave
the
law
the
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
portia
is
he
not
able
to
discharge
the
money
bassanio
yes
here
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
twice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
i
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
o
er
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
that
malice
bears
down
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
and
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
portia
it
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
twill
be
recorded

how
sweet
the
moonlight
sleeps
upon
this
bank
here
will
we
sit
and
let
the
sounds
of
music
creep
in
our
ears
soft
stillness
and
the
night
become
the
touches
of
sweet
harmony
sit
jessica
look
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
there
s
not
the
smallest
orb
which
thou
behold
st
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
young
eyed
cherubins
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
cannot
hear
it
enter
musicians
come
ho
and
wake
diana
with
a
hymn
with
sweetest
touches
pierce
your
mistress
ear
and
draw
her
home
with
music
music
jessica
i
am
never
merry
when
i
hear
sweet
music
lorenzo
the
reason
is
your
spirits
are
attentive
for
do
but
note
a
wild
and
wanton
herd
or
race
of
youthful
and
unhandled
colts
fetching
mad
bounds
bellowing
and
neighing
loud
which
is
the
hot
condition
of
their
blood
if
they
but
hear
perchance
a
trumpet
sound
or
any
air
of
music
touch
their
ears
you
shall
perceive
them
make
a
mutual
stand
their
savage
eyes
turn
d
to
a
modest
gaze
by
the
sweet
power
of
music
therefore
the
poet
did
feign
that
orpheus
drew
trees
stones
and
floods
since
nought
so
stockish
hard
and
full
of
rage
but
music
for
the
time
doth
change
his
nature
the
man
that
hath
no
music
in
himself
nor
is
not
moved
with
concord
of
sweet
sounds
is
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoils
the
motions
of
his
spirit
are
dull
as
night
and
his
affections
dark
as
erebus
let
no
such
man
be
trusted
mark
the
music
enter
portia
and
nerissa
portia
that
light
we
see
is
burning
in
my
hall
how
far
that
little
candle
throws
his
beams
so
shines
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
nerissa
when
the
moon
shone
we
did
not
see
the
candle
portia
so
doth
the
greater
glory
dim
the
less
a
substitute
shines
brightly
as
a
king
unto
the
king
be
by
and
then
his
state
empties
itself
as
doth
an
inland
brook
into
the
main
of
waters
music
hark
nerissa
it
is
your
music
madam
of
the
house
portia
nothing
is
good
i
see
without
respect
methinks
it
sounds
much
sweeter
than
by
day
nerissa
silence
bestows
that
virtue
on
it
madam
portia
the
crow
doth
sing
as
sweetly
as
the
lark
when
neither
is
attended
and
i
think
the
nightingale
if
she
should
sing
by
day
when
every
goose
is
cackling
would
be
thought
no
better
a
musician
than
the
wren
how
many
things
by
season
season
d
are
to
their
right
praise
and
true
perfection
peace
ho
the
moon
sleeps
with
endymion
and
would
not
be
awaked
music
ceases
lorenzo
that
is
the
voice
or
i
am
much
deceived
of
portia
portia
he
knows
me
as
the
blind
man
knows
the
cuckoo
by
the
bad
voice
lorenzo
dear
lady
welcome

him
he
would
not
leave
it
nor
pluck
it
from
his
finger
for
the
wealth
that
the
world
masters
now
in
faith
gratiano
you
give
your
wife
too
unkind
a
cause
of
grief
an
twere
to
me
i
should
be
mad
at
it
bassanio
[aside]
why
i
were
best
to
cut
my
left
hand
off
and
swear
i
lost
the
ring
defending
it
gratiano
my
lord
bassanio
gave
his
ring
away
unto
the
judge
that
begg
d
it
and
indeed
deserved
it
too
and
then
the
boy
his
clerk
that
took
some
pains
in
writing
he
begg
d
mine
and
neither
man
nor
master
would
take
aught
but
the
two
rings
portia
what
ring
gave
you
my
lord
not
that
i
hope
which
you
received
of
me
bassanio
if
i
could
add
a
lie
unto
a
fault
i
would
deny
it
but
you
see
my
finger
hath
not
the
ring
upon
it
it
is
gone
portia
even
so
void
is
your
false
heart
of
truth
by
heaven
i
will
ne
er
come
in
your
bed
until
i
see
the
ring
nerissa
nor
i
in
yours
till
i
again
see
mine
bassanio
sweet
portia
if
you
did
know
to
whom
i
gave
the
ring
if
you
did
know
for
whom
i
gave
the
ring
and
would
conceive
for
what
i
gave
the
ring
and
how
unwillingly
i
left
the
ring
when
nought
would
be
accepted
but
the
ring
you
would
abate
the
strength
of
your
displeasure
portia
if
you
had
known
the
virtue
of
the
ring
or
half
her
worthiness
that
gave
the
ring
or
your
own
honour
to
contain
the
ring
you
would
not
then
have
parted
with
the
ring
what
man
is
there
so
much
unreasonable
if
you
had
pleased
to
have
defended
it
with
any
terms
of
zeal
wanted
the
modesty
to
urge
the
thing
held
as
a
ceremony
nerissa
teaches
me
what
to
believe
i
ll
die
for
t
but
some
woman
had
the
ring
bassanio
no
by
my
honour
madam
by
my
soul
no
woman
had
it
but
a
civil
doctor
which
did
refuse
three
thousand
ducats
of
me
and
begg
d
the
ring
the
which
i
did
deny
him
and
suffer
d
him
to
go
displeased
away
even
he
that
did
uphold
the
very
life
of
my
dear
friend
what
should
i
say
sweet
lady
i
was
enforced
to
send
it
after
him
i
was
beset
with
shame
and
courtesy
my
honour
would
not
let
ingratitude
so
much
besmear
it
pardon
me
good
lady
for
by
these
blessed
candles
of
the
night
had
you

worthy
doctor

er
come

which
you
did
swear
to
keep
for
me

will
become
as
liberal
as

not
deny

any
thing

am
well
sure
