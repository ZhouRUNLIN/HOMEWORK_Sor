enter
octavius

reading
a
letter
lepidus
and
their
train
octavius
caesar
you
may
see
lepidus
and
henceforth
know
it
is
not
caesar
s
natural
vice
to
hate
our
great
competitor
from
alexandria
this
is
the
news
he
fishes
drinks
and
wastes
the
lamps
of
night
in
revel
is
not
more
man
like
than
cleopatra
nor
the
queen
of
ptolemy
more
womanly
than
he
hardly
gave
audience
or
vouchsafed
to
think
he
had
partners
you
shall
find
there
a
man
who
is
the
abstract
of
all
faults
that
all
men
follow
lepidus
i
must
not
think
there
are
evils
enow
to
darken
all
his
goodness
his
faults
in
him
seem
as
the
spots
of
heaven
more
fiery
by
night
s
blackness
hereditary
rather
than
purchased
what
he
cannot
change
than
what
he
chooses
octavius
caesar
you
are
too
indulgent
let
us
grant
it
is
not
amiss
to
tumble
on
the
bed
of
ptolemy
to
give
a
kingdom
for
a
mirth
to
sit
and
keep
the
turn
of
tippling
with
a
slave
to
reel
the
streets
at
noon
and
stand
the
buffet
with
knaves
that
smell
of
sweat
say
this
becomes
him
as
his
composure
must
be
rare
indeed
whom
these
things
cannot
blemish
yet
must
antony
no
way
excuse
his
soils
when
we
do
bear
so
great
weight
in
his
lightness
if
he
fill
d
his
vacancy
with
his
voluptuousness
full
surfeits
and
the
dryness
of
his
bones
call
on
him
for
t
but
to
confound
such
time
that
drums
him
from
his
sport
and
speaks
as
loud
as
his
own
state
and
ours
tis
to
be
chid

pawn

beat
to

faster
as
amorous

yes
something
you
can
deny
for

safety
you
have
been
a
great
thief
by
sea
menas
and
you
by
land
domitius
enobarbus
there
i
deny
my
land
service
but
give
me
your
hand
menas
if
our
eyes
had
authority
here
they
might
take
two
thieves
kissing

all

whatsome

their

you

we
looked
not
for

here
pray
you

he
married
to

domitius
enobarbus
caesar
s
sister
is
called
octavia
menas
true
sir
she
was
the

is
now
the

pray
ye
sir
domitius
enobarbus
tis
true
menas
then
is
caesar
and

domitius
enobarbus
if
i
were
bound
to
divine
of
this
unity
i
would
not
prophesy
so
menas
i
think
the
policy
of
that
purpose
made
more
in
the
marriage
than
the
love
of
the
parties
domitius
enobarbus
i
think
so
too
but
you
shall
find
the
band
that
seems
to
tie
their
friendship
together
will
be
the
very
strangler
of
their
amity
octavia
is
of
a
holy
cold
and
still
conversation
menas
who
would
not
have
his
wife
so
domitius

not
he
that
himself
is
not
so
which
is
mark

he
will

dish
again
then
shall
the
sighs
of
octavia
blow
the
fire
up
in
caesar
and
as
i
said
before
that
which
is
the
strength
of
their
amity
shall
prove
the
immediate
author
of
their
variance
antony

[aside]
well
i
could
reply
if
we
should
serve
with

together
the

were
merely
lost
the

would
bear
a
soldier
and
his

cleopatra
what

you

your

must
puzzle
antony
take
from

take
from

from

what

take

you
have
heard
on

sweet
cleopatra
celerity
is
never
more
admired
than
by

a

rebuke
which
might

of

to
taunt
at

canidius
we

fight
with

the

not
a

doom
in

a

of

he
is
dead

not
by

with
the

which
the

with

look
you
sad
friends
the
gods
rebuke
me
but
it
is
tidings
to
wash
the
eyes
of

agrippa
and
strange
it
is
that
nature
must
compel
us
to
lament
our
most
persisted
deeds
mecaenas
his
taints
and
honours
waged
equal
with
him
agrippa
a
rarer
spirit
never
did
steer

but
you
gods
will
give
us
some
faults
to
make
us
men
caesar
is
touch
d
mecaenas
when
such
a
spacious
mirror
s
set
before
him
he
needs
must
see
himself
octavius
caesar
o
antony
i
have
follow
d
thee
to
this
but
we
do
lance
diseases
in

i
must
perforce
have
shown
to
thee
such
a
declining
day
or
look
on
thine
we
could
not
stall
together
in
the
whole

but
yet
let
me
lament
with
tears
as
sovereign
as
the
blood
of

that
thou
my
brother
my
competitor
in
top
of
all
design
my
mate
in

friend
and
companion
in
the
front
of

the
arm
of
mine
own
body
and
the
heart
where
mine
his
thoughts
did
kindle
that
our
stars
unreconciliable
should
divide
our
equalness
to
this
hear
me
good
friends
but
i
will
tell
you
at
some
meeter

cleopatra
sole
sir
o
the
world
i
cannot
project
mine
own
cause
so
well
to
make
it
clear
but
do
confess
i
have
been
laden
with
like
frailties
which
before
have
often
shamed
our
sex
octavius
caesar
cleopatra
know
we
will
extenuate
rather
than
enforce
if
you
apply
yourself
to
our
intents
which
towards
you
are
most
gentle
you
shall
find
a
benefit
in
this
change
but
if
you
seek
to
lay
on
me
a
cruelty
by
taking
antony
s
course
you
shall
bereave
yourself
of
my
good
purposes
and
put
your
children
to
that
destruction
which
i
ll
guard
them
from
if
thereon
you
rely
i
ll
take
my
leave
cleopatra

may
through
all
the

your
scutcheons

your
signs
of

what
place
you
please
here
my
good
lord

shall
advise
me
in
all
for

cleopatra
this

reserved
to

nothing

the
truth
seleucus
seleucus
madam
i
had
rather

than
to
my

speak
that
which
is
not

what
have
i
kept
back
seleucus
enough
to
purchase
what
you
have
made
known
octavius

your

and
should
we
shift

yours
would
be

the
ingratitude
of
this
seleucus
does
even
make
me
wild
o

of
no
more
trust
than
love
that

hired
what
goest
thou
back
thou
shalt
go
back
i
warrant
thee

soulless

o
rarely

octavius
caesar
good
queen
let
us
entreat
you
cleopatra
o
caesar
what
a
wounding
shame
is
this
that
thou
vouchsafing
here
to
visit
me
doing
the
honour
of
thy
lordliness
to
one
so
meek
that
mine
own
servant
should
parcel
the
sum
of
my
disgraces
by
addition
of
his
envy
say
good
caesar
that
i
some
lady
trifles
have
reserved
immoment
toys
things
of
such
dignity
as
we
greet
modern
friends
withal
and
say
some
nobler
token
i
have
kept
apart
for
livia
and
octavia
to
induce
their
mediation
must
i
be
unfolded
with
one
that
i
have
bred
the
gods
it
smites
me
beneath
the
fall
i
have
to
seleucus
prithee
go
hence
or
i
shall
show
the
cinders
of
my
spirits
through
the
ashes
of
my
chance
wert
thou
a

thou
wouldst
have
mercy
on
me
octavius
caesar
forbear

seleucus
cleopatra
be
it
known
that
we
the
greatest
are
misthought
for
things
that

do
and
when
we
fall
we
answer
others
merits
in
our

are
therefore
to
be
pitied
octavius
caesar

not
what

i
the

very
many

yesterday
a
very
honest
woman
but
something
given
to
lie
as
a
woman

in
the
way
of
honesty
how
she
died
of
the
biting
of

what
pain

know
that
a

d
the
dreaded
act
which
thou
so
sought
st
to
hinder
within
a
way
there
a
way
for

re
enter
octavius

and
all
his

o

you

at
the
last
she
levell
d
at
our
purposes
and
being
royal
took
her
own
way
the
manner
of
their
deaths
i
do
not
see
them
bleed
dolabella
who
was
last
with
them
first

a
simple
countryman
that
brought
her
figs

was
his

octavius
caesar
poison
d
then
first
guard
o
caesar
this
charmian
lived
but
now
she
stood
and
spake
i
found
her
trimming
up
the
diadem
on
her
dead
mistress
tremblingly
she
stood
and
on
the
sudden
dropp
d
octavius
caesar
o
noble
weakness
if
they
had
swallow
d
poison
twould
appear
by
external
swelling
but
she
looks
like
sleep
as
she
would
catch
another
antony
in
her
strong
toil
of
grace
dolabella
here
on
her
breast
there
is
a
vent
of
blood

this
is
an

probable

physician
tells
me
she
hath
pursued
conclusions
infinite
of
easy
ways
to
die
take
up

bear
her

from

she
shall

shall
clip

a

so
famous
high
events
as
these
strike
those
that
make
them

their
story
is
no
less
in
pity
than
his
glory
which
brought
them
to
be
lamented
our
army
shall
in
solemn
show
attend
this
funeral
and
then
to
