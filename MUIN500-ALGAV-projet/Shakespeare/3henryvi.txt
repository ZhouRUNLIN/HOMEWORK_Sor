you

henry
had
shook

with

you
pale
your

in
henry

glory
and
rob
his

now
in

tis
a

too
too
unpardonable

more
poisons
than
the

how
ill
beseeming
is
it
in
thy
sex
to
triumph
like
an
amazonian
trull
upon
their
woes
whom
fortune
captivates
but
that
thy
face
is
vizard
like
unchanging
made
impudent
with
use
of
evil
deeds
i
would
assay
proud
queen
to
make
thee
blush
to
tell
thee
whence
thou
camest
of

derived
were
shame
enough
to
shame
thee
wert
thou
not
shameless
thy
father
bears
the
type
of
king
of
naples
of
both
the
sicils
and
jerusalem
yet
not
so
wealthy
as
an
english
yeoman
hath
that
poor
monarch
taught
thee
to
insult
it
needs
not
nor
it
boots
thee
not
proud
queen
unless
the
adage
must
be
verified
that
beggars
mounted
run
their
horse
to
death
tis
beauty
that
doth
oft
make
women
proud
but
god
he
knows
thy
share
thereof
is
small
tis
virtue
that
doth
make
them
most
admired
the
contrary
doth
make
thee
wonder
d
at
tis
government
that
makes
them
seem
divine
the
want
thereof
makes
thee
abominable
thou
art
as
opposite
to
every
good
as
the
antipodes
are
unto
us
or
as
the
south
to
the
septentrion
o
tiger

thou
drain

wipe
his

withal

be
seen
to

should
have
heard
the
happy
tidings
of
his
good
escape
how
fares
my
brother
why
is
he
so
sad
richard
i
cannot
joy
until
i
be
resolved
where
our
right
valiant
father
is
become
i
saw
him
in
the
battle
range
about
and
watch
d
him
how
he
singled
clifford
forth
methought
he
bore
him
in
the
thickest
troop
as
doth
a
lion
in
a
herd
of
neat
or
as
a
bear
encompass
d
round
with
dogs
who
having
pinch
d
a
few
and
made
them
cry
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
and
bark
at
him
so
fared
our
father
with
his
enemies
so
fled
his
enemies
my
warlike
father
methinks
tis
prize
enough
to
be
his
son
see
how
the
morning
opes
her
golden
gates
and
takes
her
farewell
of
the
glorious
sun
how
well
resembles
it
the
prime
of
youth
trimm
d
like
a
younker
prancing
to
his
love
edward
dazzle
mine
eyes
or
do
i
see
three
suns
richard
three
glorious
suns
each
one
a
perfect
sun
not
separated
with
the
racking
clouds
but
sever
d
in
a
pale
clear
shining
sky
see
see
they
join
embrace
and
seem
to
kiss
as
if
they
vow
d
some
league
inviolable
now
are
they
but
one
lamp
one
light
one
sun
in
this
the
heaven
figures
some
event
edward
tis
wondrous
strange
the
like
yet
never
heard
of
i
think
it
cites
us
brother
to
the
field
that
we
the
sons
of
brave
plantagenet
each
one
already
blazing
by
our
meeds
should
notwithstanding
join
our
lights
together
and
over
shine
the
earth
as
this
the
world
whate
er
it
bodes
henceforward
will
i
bear
upon
my
target
three
fair
shining
suns

bear
three
daughters

your
leave

what
art
thou
whose
heavy
looks
foretell
some
dreadful
story
hanging
on
thy
tongue
messenger
ah
one
that
was
a
woful
looker
on
when
as
the
noble
duke
of
york
was
slain
your
princely
father
and
my
loving
lord
edward
o
speak
no
more
for
i
have
heard
too
much
richard
say
how
he
died
for
i
will
hear
it
all
messenger
environed
he
was
with
many
foes
and
stood
against
them
as
the
hope
of
troy
against
the
greeks
that
would
have
enter
d
troy
but
hercules
himself
must
yield
to
odds
and
many
strokes
though
with
a
little
axe
hew
down
and
fell
the
hardest
timber
d
oak
by
many
hands
your
father
was
subdued
but
only
slaughter
d
by
the
ireful
arm
of
unrelenting
clifford
and
the
queen
who
crown
d
the
gracious
duke
in
high
despite
laugh
d
in
his
face
and
when
with
grief
he
wept
the
ruthless
queen
gave
him
to
dry
his
cheeks
a
napkin
steeped
in
the
harmless
blood
of
sweet
young
rutland
by
rough
clifford
slain
and
after
many
scorns
many
foul
taunts
they
took
his
head
and
on
the
gates
of
york
they
set
the
same
and
there
it
doth
remain
the
saddest
spectacle
that

er
i

prop
to
lean
upon

slain
edward
o

warwick
that
plantagenet
which
held

dearly
as
his

stern
lord

done
to

ten
days
ago
i
drown
d
these
news
in
tears
and
now
to
add
more
measure
to
your
woes
i
come
to
tell
you
things
sith
then
befall
n
after
the
bloody
fray
at
wakefield
fought
where
your
brave
father
breathed
his
latest
gasp
tidings
as
swiftly
as
the
posts
could
run
were
brought
me
of
your
loss
and
his
depart
i
then
in
london
keeper
of
the
king
muster
d
my
soldiers
gather
d
flocks
of
friends
and
very
well
appointed
as
i
thought
march
d
toward
saint
alban
s
to
intercept
the
queen
bearing
the
king
in
my
behalf
along
for
by
my
scouts
i
was
advertised
that
she
was
coming
with
a
full
intent
to
dash
our
late
decree
in
parliament
touching
king
henry
s
oath
and
your
succession
short
tale
to
make
we
at
saint
alban
s
met
our
battles
join
d
and
both
sides
fiercely
fought
but
whether
twas
the
coldness
of
the
king
who
look
d
full
gently
on
his
warlike
queen
that
robb
d
my
soldiers
of
their
heated
spleen
or
whether
twas
report
of
her
success
or
more
than
common
fear
of
clifford
s
rigour
who
thunders
to
his
captives
blood
and
death
i
cannot
judge
but
to
conclude
with
truth
their
weapons
like
to
lightning
came
and
went
our
soldiers
like
the
night
owl
s
lazy
flight
or
like
an
idle
thresher
with
a
flail
fell
gently
down
as
if
they
struck
their
friends
i
cheer
d
them
up
with
justice
of
our
cause
with
promise
of
high
pay
and
great
rewards
but
all
in
vain
they
had
no
heart
to
fight
and
we
in
them
no
hope
to
win
the
day
so
that
we
fled
the
king
unto
the
queen
lord
george
your
brother
norfolk
and
myself
in
haste
post
haste
are
come
to
join
with
you
for
in

here
we
heard
you
were
making
another
head
to

where

gentle
warwick
and
when

george
from

richard
dost
thou
hear
for
thou
shalt
know
this
strong
right
hand
of
mine
can
pluck
the
diadem
from
faint
henry

wring
the
awful

troublous
time
what

to

we
go
throw
away
our
coats
of
steel
and
wrap
our
bodies
in
black
mourning
gowns
numbering
our
ave
maries
with
our
beads
or
shall
we
on
the
helmets
of
our
foes
tell
our
devotion

revengeful
arms

gone
to
frustrate

what
beside

make
against
the
house
of
lancaster
their

i
think

thirty
thousand
strong

myself
with
all
the
friends
that
thou
brave

of

think
you

that

no
tis
impossible
he
should
escape
for

which
takes

now
the

let

richard
revoke
that
doom
of

for
tis
clifford
who
not
contented
that
he
lopp
d
the
branch
in
hewing
rutland
when
his
leaves
put
forth
but
set
his
murdering
knife
unto
the
root
from
whence
that
tender
spray
did
sweetly
spring
i
mean
our
princely
father
duke
of
york
warwick
from
off
the
gates
of
york
fetch
down
the
head
your
father
s
head
which
clifford
placed
there
instead
whereof
let
this
supply
the
room
measure
for
measure
must
be
answered
edward
bring
forth
that
fatal
screech
owl
to
our
house
that
nothing
sung
but
death
to
us
and
ours
now
death
shall
stop
his
dismal
threatening
sound
and
his
ill
boding
tongue
no
more
shall
speak
warwick
i
think
his
understanding
is
bereft
speak
clifford
dost
thou
know
who
speaks
to
thee
dark
cloudy
death
o
ershades
his
beams
of
life
and
he
nor
sees
nor
hears
us
what
we
say
richard
o
would
he
did
and
so
perhaps
he
doth
tis
but
his
policy
to
counterfeit
because
he
would
avoid
such
bitter
taunts
which
in
the
time
of
death
he
gave
our
father
george
if
so
thou
think
st
vex
him
with
eager
words
richard
clifford
ask
mercy
and
obtain
no
grace
edward
clifford
repent
in
bootless
penitence
warwick
clifford
devise
excuses
for
thy
faults
george
while
we
devise
fell
tortures
for
thy

richard
thou
didst

edward
thou
pitied

to
fence
you
now
warwick
they
mock
thee
clifford
swear
as
thou
wast
wont
richard
what
not
an
oath
nay
then
the
world
goes
hard
when
clifford
cannot
spare
his
friends
an
oath
i
know
by
that
he
s
dead
and
by
my
soul
if
this
right
hand
would
buy
two
hour
s
life
that
i
in
all
despite
might
rail
at
him
this
hand
should
chop
it
off
and
with
the
issuing
blood
stifle
the
villain
whose
unstanched
thirst
york
and
young
rutland
could
not
satisfy
warwick
ay
but
he
s
dead
off
with

that

i
look
for

between
my

me
the
lustful
edward

henry

his

young
edward

all
the
unlook
d
for
issue
of
their
bodies
to
take
their
rooms
ere
i
can
place
myself
a
cold
premeditation
for
my
purpose
why
then
i
do
but
dream
on
sovereignty
like
one
that
stands
upon
a
promontory
and
spies
a
far
off
shore
where
he
would
tread
wishing
his
foot
were
equal
with
his
eye
and
chides
the
sea
that
sunders
him
from
thence
saying
he
ll
lade
it
dry
to
have
his
way
so
do
i
wish
the
crown
being
so
far
off
and
so
i
chide
the
means
that
keeps
me
from
it
and
so
i
say
i
ll
cut
the
causes
off
flattering
me
with
impossibilities
my
eye
s
too
quick
my
heart
o
erweens
too
much
unless
my
hand
and
strength
could
equal
them
well
say
there
is
no
kingdom
then
for
richard
what
other
pleasure
can
the
world
afford
i
ll
make
my
heaven
in
a
lady
s
lap
and
deck
my
body
in
gay
ornaments
and
witch
sweet
ladies
with
my
words
and
looks
o
miserable
thought
and
more
unlikely
than
to
accomplish
twenty
golden
crowns
why
love
forswore
me
in
my
mother
s
womb
and
for
i
should
not
deal
in
her
soft
laws
she
did
corrupt
frail
nature
with
some
bribe
to
shrink
mine
arm
up
like
a
wither
d
shrub
to
make
an
envious
mountain
on
my
back
where
sits
deformity
to
mock
my
body
to
shape
my
legs
of
an
unequal
size
to
disproportion
me
in
every
part
like
to
a
chaos

an
unlick
d
bear
whelp
that
carries
no

like
the

am
i
then
a

to
be

o
monstrous
fault
to

such
a
thought
then
since
this

affords
no
joy
to
me
but
to
command
to
cheque
to
o
erbear
such
as
are
of
better

than
myself
i
ll
make
my
heaven
to
dream
upon
the

and
whiles
i
live
to
account
this
world
but
hell
until
my
mis
shaped
trunk
that
bears
this
head
be
round
impaled
with
a
glorious
crown
and
yet
i
know
not
how
to
get
the
crown
for
many
lives
stand
between
me
and
home
and
i
like
one
lost
in
a
thorny
wood
that
rends
the
thorns
and
is
rent
with
the
thorns
seeking
a
way
and
straying
from
the
way
not
knowing
how
to
find
the
open
air
but
toiling
desperately
to
find
it
out
torment
myself
to
catch
the
english
crown
and
from
that
torment
i
will
free
myself
or
hew
my
way
out
with
a
bloody
axe
why
i
can
smile
and
murder
whiles
i
smile
and
cry
content
to
that
which
grieves
my
heart
and
wet
my
cheeks
with
artificial
tears
and
frame
my
face
to
all
occasions
i
ll
drown
more
sailors
than

play
the

warwick
from

my

thy

i
come
in
kindness
and
unfeigned
love
first
to
do
greetings
to
thy
royal
person
and
then
to
crave
a
league
of
amity
and
lastly
to
confirm
that
amity
with
a
nuptial
knot
if
thou
vouchsafe
to
grant
that
virtuous
lady
bona
thy
fair
sister
to
england
s
king
in
lawful

queen
margaret
[aside]
if
that
go
forward
henry

is
done
warwick
[to

and
gracious
madam
in
our

i
am
commanded
with
your
leave
and
favour
humbly
to
kiss
your
hand
and
with
my
tongue
to
tell
the
passion
of
my
sovereign
s
heart
where
fame
late
entering
at
his
heedful
ears
hath
placed
thy
beauty
s
image
and
thy
virtue
queen
margaret
king
lewis
and
lady
bona
hear
me
speak
before
you
answer
warwick
his
demand
springs
not
from
edward
s
well
meant
honest
love
but
from
deceit
bred
by
necessity
for
how
can
tyrants
safely
govern
home
unless
abroad
they
purchase
great
alliance
to
prove
him
tyrant
this
reason
may
suffice
that
henry
liveth
still
but
were
he
dead
yet
here
prince
edward
stands
king
henry
s
son
look
therefore
lewis
that
by
this
league
and
marriage
thou
draw
not
on
thy
danger
and
dishonour
for
though
usurpers
sway
the
rule
awhile
yet
heavens
are
just
and
time
suppresseth
wrongs
warwick
injurious
margaret
prince
edward
and
why
not
queen
warwick
because
thy
father
henry
did
usurp
and
thou
no
more
are
prince
than
she
is
queen
oxford
then
warwick
disannuls
great
john
of
gaunt
which
did
subdue
the
greatest
part
of
spain
and
after
john
of
gaunt
henry
the
fourth
whose
wisdom
was
a
mirror
to
the
wisest
and
after
that
wise
prince
henry
the
fifth
who
by
his
prowess
conquered
all
france
from
these
our
henry
lineally
descends
warwick
oxford
how
haps
it
in
this
smooth
discourse
you
told
not
how
henry
the
sixth
hath
lost
all
that
which
henry
fifth
had
gotten
methinks
these
peers
of
france
should
smile
at
that
but
for
the
rest
you
tell
a
pedigree
of
threescore
and
two
years
a
silly
time
to
make
prescription
for
a
kingdom
s
worth
oxford
why
warwick
canst
thou
speak
against
thy
liege
whom
thou
obeyed
st
thirty
and
six
years
and
not
bewray
thy
treason
with
a
blush
warwick
can
oxford
that
did
ever
fence
the
right
now
buckler
falsehood
with
a
pedigree
for
shame
leave
henry
and
call
edward

oxford
call
him
my
king
by
whose
injurious
doom
my
elder
brother
the
lord
aubrey
vere
was
done
to
death
and
more
than
so
my
father
even
in
the
downfall
of
his
mellow
d
years
when
nature
brought
him
to
the
door
of
death
no

grant

bewitch
him
not
king

now
warwick
tell
me
even
upon
thy
conscience
is
edward
your
true
king
for
i
were
loath
to
link
with
him
that
were
not
lawful
chosen
warwick
thereon
i
pawn
my
credit
and
mine
honour
king
lewis
xi
but
is
he
gracious
in
the
people
s
eye
warwick
the
more
that
henry
was
unfortunate
king
lewis
xi
then
further
all
dissembling
set
aside
tell
me
for
truth
the
measure
of
his
love
unto
our
sister
bona
warwick
such
it
seems
as
may
beseem
a
monarch
like
himself
myself
have
often
heard
him
say
and
swear
that
this
his
love
was
an
eternal
plant
whereof
the
root
was
fix
d
in
virtue
s
ground
the
leaves
and
fruit
maintain
d
with
beauty
s
sun
exempt
from
envy
but
not
from
disdain
unless
the
lady
bona
quit
his
pain
king
lewis
xi
now
sister
let
us
hear
your
firm
resolve
bona
your
grant
or
your
denial
shall
be
mine
to
warwick
yet
i
confess
that
often
ere
this
day
when
i
have
heard
your
king
s
desert
recounted
mine
ear
hath
tempted
judgment
to
desire
king
lewis
xi
then
warwick
thus
our
sister
shall
be
edward
s
and
now
forthwith
shall
articles
be
drawn
touching
the
jointure
that
your
king
must
make
which
with
her
dowry
shall
be
counterpoised
draw
near
queen
margaret
and
be
a
witness
that
bona
shall
be
wife
to
the
english
king
prince
edward
to
edward
but
not
to
the
english
king
queen
margaret
deceitful
warwick
it
was
thy
device
by
this
alliance
to
make
void
my
suit
before
thy
coming
lewis
was
henry
s
friend
king
lewis
xi
and
still
is
friend
to
him
and
margaret
but
if
your
title
to
the
crown
be
weak
as
may
appear
by
edward
s
good
success
then
tis
but
reason
that
i
be
released
from
giving
aid
which
late
i
promised
yet
shall
you
have
all
kindness
at
my
hand
that
your
estate
requires
and
mine
can
yield
warwick
henry
now
lives
in

as
my
letters

likely

what

alas
you
know
tis
far
from

how
could
he
stay
till
warwick
made

my
lords
forbear
this
talk
here
comes
the
king
gloucester
and
his
well
chosen
bride
clarence
i
mind
to
tell
him
plainly
what
i
think
flourish
enter
king
edward
iv
attended
queen
elizabeth
pembroke
stafford
hastings
and
others
king
edward
iv
now
brother
of
clarence
how
like
you
our
choice
that
you
stand
pensive
as
half
malcontent
clarence
as
well
as
lewis
of
france
or
the
earl
of
warwick
which
are
so
weak
of
courage
and
in
judgment
that
they
ll
take
no
offence
at
our
abuse
king
edward
iv
suppose
they
take
offence
without
a
cause
they
are
but
lewis
and
warwick
i
am
edward
your
king
and
warwick
s
and
must
have
my
will
gloucester
and
shall
have
your
will
because
our
king
yet
hasty
marriage
seldom
proveth
well
king
edward
iv
yea
brother
richard
are
you
offended
too
gloucester
not
i
no
god
forbid
that
i
should
wish
them
sever
d
whom
god
hath
join
d
together
ay
and
twere
pity
to
sunder
them
that
yoke
so
well
together
king
edward
iv
setting
your
scorns
and
your
mislike
aside
tell
me
some
reason
why
the
lady
grey
should
not
become
my
wife
and
england
s
queen
and
you
too
somerset
and
montague
speak
freely
what
you
think
clarence
then
this
is
mine
opinion
that
king
lewis
becomes
your
enemy
for
mocking
him
about
the
marriage
of
the
lady
bona
gloucester
and
warwick
doing
what
you
gave
in
charge
is
now
dishonoured
by
this
new
marriage
king
edward
iv
what
if
both
lewis
and
warwick
be
appeased
by
such
invention
as
i
can
devise
montague
yet
to
have
join
d
with
france
in
such
alliance
would
more
have
strengthen
d
this
our
commonwealth
gainst
foreign
storms
than
any
home
bred
marriage
hastings
why
knows
not
montague
that
of
itself
england
is
safe
if
true
within
itself
montague
but
the
safer
when
tis
back
d
with
france
hastings
tis
better
using
france
than
trusting
france
let
us
be
back
d
with
god
and
with
the
seas
which
he
hath
given
for
fence
impregnable
and
with
their
helps
only
defend
ourselves
in
them
and
in
ourselves
our
safety
lies
clarence
for
this
one
speech
lord
hastings
well
deserves
to
have
the
heir
of
the
lord
hungerford
king
edward
iv
ay
what
of
that
it
was
my
will
and
grant
and
for
this
once
my
will
shall
stand
for
law
gloucester
and
yet
methinks
your
grace
hath
not
done
well
to
give
the
heir
and
daughter
of
lord
scales
unto
the
brother
of
your
loving
bride
she
better
would
have
fitted
me
or
clarence
but
in
your
bride
you
bury
brotherhood
clarence
or
else
you
would
not
have
bestow
d
the
heir
of
the
lord
bonville
on
your
new
wife
s
son
and
leave
your
brothers
to
go
speed
elsewhere
king
edward
iv
alas
poor
clarence
is
it
for
a
wife
that
thou
art
malcontent
i
will
provide
thee
clarence
in
choosing
for
yourself
you
show
d
your
judgment
which
being
shallow
you
give
me
leave
to
play
the
broker
in
mine
own
behalf
and
to
that
end
i
shortly
mind
to
leave
you
king
edward
iv
leave
me
or
tarry
edward
will
be
king
and
not
be
tied
unto
his
brother
s
will
queen
elizabeth
my
lords
before
it
pleased
his
majesty
to
raise
my
state
to
title
of
a
queen
do
me
but
right
and
you
must
all
confess
that
i
was
not
ignoble
of
descent
and
meaner
than
myself
have
had
like
fortune
but
as
this
title
honours
me
and
mine
so
your
dislike
to
whom
i
would
be
pleasing
doth
cloud
my
joys
with
danger
and
with
sorrow
king
edward
iv
my
love
forbear
to
fawn
upon
their
frowns
what
danger
or
what
sorrow
can
befall
thee
so
long
as
edward
is
thy
constant
friend
and
their
true
sovereign
whom
they
must
obey
nay
whom
they
shall
obey
and
love
thee
too
unless
they
seek
for
hatred
at
my
hands
which
if
they
do
yet
will
i
keep
thee
safe
and
they
shall
feel
the
vengeance
of
my
wrath
gloucester
[aside]
i
hear
yet
say
not
much
but
think
the
more

very
words

i
blame
not

what
said

majesty
than
all
the
rest
discharged
me
with
these
words
tell
him
from
me
that
he
hath
done

wrong
and
therefore
i
ll
uncrown
him
ere

durst
the
traitor
breathe
out
so
proud
words
well

will
arm

for
their
presumption

ere

my
doubt
you
twain
of
all
the
rest
are
near
to
warwick
by
blood
and
by
alliance
tell
me
if
you
love

more
than

so
then

friends
but
if

to
hold
your
true
obedience
give
me
assurance
with
some
friendly
vow
that
i
may
never
have
you
in
suspect
montague
so

as
he
proves
true
hastings

you
stand
by

to

mistrustful
where
a
noble
heart
hath
pawn
d
an
open
hand
in
sign
of
love
else
might
i
think
that

but
welcome
sweet
clarence
my

shall

but
in

coverture
thy
brother
being
carelessly
encamp
d
his
soldiers
lurking
in
the
towns
about
and
but
attended
by
a
simple
guard
we
may
surprise
and
take
him
at
our
pleasure
our
scouts
have
found
the
adventure
very
easy
that
as
ulysses
and
stout
diomede
with
sleight
and
manhood
stole
to
rhesus
tents
and
brought
from
thence
the
thracian
fatal
steeds
so
we
well
cover
d
with
the
night
s
black
mantle
at
unawares
may
beat
down
edward
s
guard
and
seize
himself
i
say
not
slaughter
him
for
i
intend
but
only
to
surprise
him
you
that
will
follow
me
to
this
attempt
applaud
the
name
of
henry
with
your
leader
they
all
cry
henry
why
then
let

in
silent
sort
for

the

by
this
is
set
him
down
to
sleep
second

what
will
he
not

why
no

never
to
lie
and
take
his
natural
rest
till
warwick
or
himself
be
quite
suppress

then
belike

say
i
pray
what
nobleman
is

first
watchman
tis
the
lord
hastings
the

about
him
while
he
himself
keeps
in
the
cold
field
second
watchman
tis
the
more
honour
because
more
dangerous
third
watchman
ay
but
give
me
worship
and
quietness
i
like
it
better
than
a
dangerous
honour
if
warwick
knew
in
what
estate
he
stands
tis
to
be
doubted
he
would
waken
him
first
watchman
unless
our
halberds
did
shut
up
his
passage
second

they
quite

warwick
after

thou
set

and
chiefly
therefore
i
thank
god
and
thee
he
was
the
author
thou
the
instrument
therefore
that
i
may
conquer
fortune
s
spite
by
living
low

fortune
cannot
hurt
me
and
that
the

of
this
blessed

may
not

d
with
my
thwarting
stars
warwick
although
my
head
still
wear
the
crown
i
here
resign
my
government
to
thee
for
thou
art
fortunate
in
all
thy
deeds
warwick
your
grace
hath
still
been
famed
for
virtuous
and
now
may
seem
as
wise
as
virtuous
by
spying
and
avoiding
fortune
s
malice
for
few
men
rightly
temper
with
the
stars
yet
in
this
one
thing
let
me
blame
your
grace
for
choosing
me
when
clarence
is
in

clarence
no
warwick
thou
art
worthy
of
the
sway
to
whom
the
heavens
in
thy
nativity
adjudged
an
olive
branch
and
laurel
crown
as
likely
to
be
blest
in
peace
and
war
and
therefore
i
yield
thee
my
free
consent
warwick
and
i
choose
clarence
only
for
protector
king
henry
vi
warwick
and
clarence
give
me
both
your
hands
now
join
your
hands
and
with
your

your
hearts
that
no
dissension
hinder
government
i
make
you
both
protectors
of
this
land
while
i
myself
will
lead
a
private
life
and
in
devotion
spend
my
latter
days
to
sin
s
rebuke
and
my
creator
s
praise
warwick
what
answers
clarence
to
his
sovereign
s
will
clarence
that
he
consents
if
warwick
yield
consent
for
on
thy
fortune
i
repose
myself
warwick
why
then
though
loath
yet
must
i
be
content
we
ll
yoke
together
like
a
double
shadow
to
henry
s
body
and
supply
his
place
i
mean
in
bearing
weight
of
government
while
he
enjoys
the
honour
and
his
ease
and
clarence
now
then
it
is
more
than
needful
forthwith
that
edward
be
pronounced
a
traitor
and
all
his
lands
and
goods
be
confiscate
clarence
what
else
and
that
succession
be
determined
warwick
ay
therein
clarence
shall
not
want
his
part
king
henry

but
with
the
first
of

more
that
margaret
your
queen

see
them
here
by
doubtful
fear
my
joy
of

is
half
eclipsed
clarence
it
shall
be
done
my
sovereign
with
all
speed
king
henry
vi
my
lord
of
somerset
what
youth
is
that
of
whom
you
seem
to
have
so
tender

somerset
my
liege
it
is
young
henry
earl
of
richmond
king
henry
vi
come
hither
england
s
hope
lays
his
hand
on
his
head
if
secret
powers
suggest
but
truth
to
my
divining
thoughts
this
pretty
lad
will
prove
our
country
s
bliss
his
looks
are
full
of
peaceful
majesty
his
head
by
nature
framed
to
wear
a
crown
his
hand
to
wield
a
sceptre
and
himself
likely
in
time
to
bless
a
regal
throne
make
much
of
him
my
lords
for
this
is
he
must
help
you
more
than
you
are
hurt
by

enter

news
my
friend
post
that
edward

but
how
made
he
escape

he
was
convey

hastings
who
attended
him
in
secret
ambush
on
the
forest
side
and
from
the
bishop
s
huntsmen
rescued
him
for
hunting
was
his
daily
exercise
warwick
my
brother
was
too
careless
of
his
charge
but
let
us
hence
my
sovereign
to
provide
a
salve
for
any
sore
that
may
betide
exeunt
all
but
somerset
henry
of
richmond
and
oxford
somerset
my
lord
i
like
not
of
this
flight
of
edward
s
for
doubtless
burgundy
will
yield
him
help
and
we
shall
have
more
wars
before
t
be
long
as
henry
s
late
presaging
prophecy
did
glad
my
heart
with
hope
of
this
young
richmond
so
doth
my
heart
misgive
me
in
these
conflicts
what
may
befall
him
to
his
harm
and
ours
therefore
lord
oxford
to
prevent
the
worst
forthwith
we
ll
send
him
hence
to
brittany
till
storms
be
past
of
civil
enmity
oxford
ay
for
if
edward
repossess
the

tis
like
that
richmond
with
the
rest
shall

somerset
it
shall
be
so
he
shall

come

hastings
and
the

yet
thus
far
fortune
maketh
us
amends
and
says
that
once
more
i
shall
interchange
my
waned
state
for
henry
s
regal
crown
well
have
we
pass
d
and
now
repass
d
the

and
brought
desired
help
from
burgundy
what
then
remains
we
being
thus
arrived
from
ravenspurgh
haven
before
the
gates
of
york
but
that
we
enter
as
into
our
dukedom
gloucester
the
gates
made
fast
brother
i
like
not
this
for
many
men
that
stumble
at
the
threshold
are
well
foretold
that
danger
lurks
within
king
edward
iv
tush
man
abodements
must
not
now
affright
us
by
fair
or
foul
means
we
must
enter
in
for
hither
will
our
friends
repair
to
us
hastings
my
liege
i
ll
knock
once
more
to
summon
them
enter
on
the
walls
the
mayor
of
york
and
his
brethren
mayor
my
lords
we
were
forewarned
of
your
coming
and
shut
the
gates
for
safety
of
ourselves
for
now
we
owe
allegiance
unto
henry
king
edward
iv
but
master
mayor
if
henry
be
your
king
yet
edward
at
the
least
is
duke
of
york
mayor
true
my
good
lord
i
know
you
for
no
less
king
edward
iv
why
and
i
challenge
nothing
but
my
dukedom
as
being
well
content
with
that
alone
gloucester
[aside]
but
when
the
fox
hath
once
got
in
his
nose
he
ll
soon
find
means
to
make
the
body
follow
hastings
why
master
mayor
why
stand
you
in
a
doubt
open
the
gates
we
are
king
henry
s
friends
mayor
ay
say
you
so
the
gates
shall
then
be
open
d
they
descend
gloucester
a
wise
stout
captain
and
soon
persuaded
hastings
the
good
old
man
would
fain
that
all
were
well
so
twere
not
long
of
him
but
being
enter
d
i
doubt
not
i
but
we
shall
soon
persuade
both
him
and
all
his
brothers
unto
reason
enter
the
mayor
and
two
aldermen
below
king
edward
iv
so
master
mayor
these
gates
must
not
be
shut
but
in
the
night
or
in
the
time
of
war
what
fear
not
