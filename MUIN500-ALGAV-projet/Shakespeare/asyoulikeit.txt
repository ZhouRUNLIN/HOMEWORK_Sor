as
you
like
it
act
i
scene
i
orchard
of
oliver
s
house
enter
orlando
and
adam
orlando
as
i
remember
adam
it
was
upon
this
fashion
bequeathed
me
by
will
but
poor
a
thousand
crowns
and
as
thou
sayest
charged
my
brother
on
his
blessing
to
breed
me
well
and
there
begins
my
sadness
my
brother
jaques
he
keeps
at
school
and
report
speaks
goldenly
of
his
profit
for
my
part
he
keeps
me
rustically
at
home
or
to
speak
more
properly
stays
me
here
at
home
unkept
for
call
you
that
keeping
for
a
gentleman
of
my
birth
that
differs
not
from
the
stalling
of
an
ox
his
horses
are
bred
better
for
besides
that
they
are
fair
with
their
feeding
they
are
taught
their
manage
and
to
that
end
riders
dearly
hired
but
i
his
brother
gain
nothing
under
him
but
growth
for
the
which
his
animals
on
his
dunghills
are
as
much
bound
to
him
as
i
besides
this
nothing
that
he
so
plentifully
gives
me
the
something
that
nature
gave
me
his
countenance
seems
to
take
from
me
he
lets
me
feed
with
his
hinds
bars
me
the
place
of
a
brother
and
as
much
as
in
him
lies
mines
my
gentility
with
my
education
this
is
it
adam
that
grieves
me
and
the
spirit
of
my
father
which
i
think
is
within
me
begins
to
mutiny
against
this
servitude
i
will
no
longer
endure
it

no
wise
remedy
how
to
avoid
it

died
to
stay
behind
her
she
is
at
the
court
and
no
less
beloved
of
her

daughter
and
never
two
ladies
loved
as
they
do
oliver
where

the

duke
live
charles
they
say
he
is
already
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
a
many
merry
men
with
him
and
there
they
live
like
the
old
robin
hood
of
england
they
say
many
young
gentlemen
flock
to
him
every
day
and
fleet
the
time
carelessly
as
they
did
in
the
golden
world
oliver
what
you
wrestle
to
morrow
before
the
new
duke
charles
marry
do
i
sir
and
i
came
to
acquaint
you
with
a
matter
i
am
given
sir
secretly
to
understand
that
your
younger
brother
orlando
hath
a
disposition
to
come
in
disguised
against
me
to
try
a
fall
to
morrow
sir
i
wrestle
for
my
credit
and
he
that
escapes
me
without
some
broken
limb
shall
acquit
him
well
your
brother
is
but
young
and
tender
and
for
your
love
i
would
be
loath
to
foil
him
as
i
must
for
my
own
honour
if
he
come
in
therefore
out
of
my
love
to
you
i
came
hither
to
acquaint
you
withal
that
either
you
might
stay
him
from
his
intendment
or
brook
such
disgrace
well
as
he
shall
run
into
in
that
it
is
a
thing
of
his
own
search
and
altogether
against
my
will
oliver
charles
i
thank
thee
for
thy
love
to
me
which
thou
shalt
find
i
will
most
kindly
requite
i
had
myself
notice
of
my
brother
s
purpose
herein
and
have
by
underhand
means
laboured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
is
resolute
i
ll
tell
thee
charles
it
is
the
stubbornest
young
fellow
of
france
full
of
ambition
an
envious
emulator
of
every
man
s
good
parts
a
secret
and
villanous
contriver
against
me
his
natural
brother
therefore
use
thy
discretion
i
had
as
lief
thou
didst
break
his
neck
as
his
finger
and
thou
wert
best
look
to
t
for
if
thou
dost
him
any
slight
disgrace
or
if
he
do
not
mightily
grace
himself
on
thee
he
will
practise
against
thee
by
poison
entrap
thee
by
some
treacherous
device
and
never
leave
thee
till
he
hath
ta
en
thy
life
by
some
indirect
means
or
other
for
i
assure
thee
and
almost
with
tears
i
speak
it
there
is
not
one
so
young
and
so
villanous
this
day
living
i
speak
but
brotherly
of
him
but
should
i
anatomize
him
to
thee
as
he
is
i
must
blush
and
weep
and
thou
must
look
pale
and
wonder
charles
i
am
heartily
glad
i
came
hither
to
you
if
he
come
to
morrow
i
ll
give
him
his
payment
if
ever
he
go
alone
again
i
ll
never
wrestle
for
prize
more
and
so
god
keep
your
worship
oliver
farewell
good
charles
exit
charles
now
will
i
stir
this
gamester
i
hope
i
shall
see
an
end
of
him
for
my
soul
yet
i
know
not
why
hates
nothing
more
than
he
yet
he
s
gentle
never
schooled
and
yet
learned
full
of
noble
device
of
all
sorts
enchantingly
beloved
and
indeed
so
much
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
especially
of
my
own
people
who
best
know
him
that
i
am
altogether
misprised
but
it
shall
not
be
so
long
this
wrestler
shall
clear
all
nothing
remains
but
that
i
kindle
the
boy
thither
which
now
i
ll
go
about

i
pray
thee
rosalind
sweet
my
coz
be
merry
rosalind
dear
celia
i
show
more
mirth
than
i
am
mistress
of
and
would
you
yet
i
were
merrier
unless
you
could
teach
me
to
forget
a
banished
father
you
must
not
learn
me
how
to
remember
any
extraordinary
pleasure
celia
herein
i
see
thou
lovest
me
not
with
the
full
weight
that
i
love
thee
if
my
uncle
thy
banished
father
had
banished
thy
uncle
the
duke
my
father
so
thou
hadst
been
still
with
me
i
could
have
taught
my
love
to
take
thy
father
for
mine
so
wouldst
thou
if
the
truth
of
thy
love
to
me
were
so
righteously
tempered
as
mine
is
to
thee
rosalind
well
i
will
forget
the
condition
of
my
estate
to
rejoice
in
yours
celia
you
know
my
father
hath
no
child
but
i
nor
none
is
like
to
have
and
truly
when
he
dies
thou
shalt
be
his
heir
for
what
he
hath
taken
away
from
thy
father
perforce
i
will
render
thee
again
in
affection
by
mine
honour
i
will
and
when
i
break
that
oath
let
me
turn
monster
therefore
my
sweet
rose
my
dear
rose
be
merry
rosalind
from
henceforth
i
will
coz
and
devise
sports
let
me
see
what
think
you
of
falling
in
love
celia
marry
i
prithee
do
to
make
sport
withal
but
love
no
man
in
good
earnest
nor
no
further
in
sport
neither
than
with
safety
of
a
pure
blush
thou
mayst
in
honour
come
off
again
rosalind
what
shall
be
our
sport
then
celia
let
us
sit
and
mock
the
good
housewife
fortune
from
her
wheel
that
her
gifts
may
henceforth
be
bestowed
equally
rosalind
i
would
we
could
do
so
for
her
benefits
are
mightily
misplaced
and
the
bountiful
blind
woman
doth
most
mistake
in
her
gifts
to
women
celia
tis
true
for
those
that
she
makes
fair
she
scarce
makes
honest
and
those
that
she
makes
honest
she
makes
very
ill
favouredly
rosalind
nay
now
thou
goest
from
fortune
s
office
to
nature
s
fortune
reigns
in
gifts
of
the
world
not
in
the
lineaments
of
nature
enter
touchstone
celia
no
when
nature
hath
made
a
fair
creature
may
she
not
by
fortune
fall
into
the
fire
though
nature
hath
given
us
wit
to
flout
at
fortune
hath
not
fortune
sent
in
this
fool
to
cut
off
the
argument
rosalind
indeed
there
is
fortune
too
hard
for
nature
when
fortune
makes
nature
s
natural
the
cutter
off
of
nature
s
wit
celia
peradventure
this
is
not
fortune
s
work
neither
but
nature
s
who
perceiveth
our
natural
wits
too
dull
to
reason
of
such
goddesses
and
hath
sent
this
natural
for
our
whetstone
for
always
the
dulness
of
the
fool
is
the
whetstone
of
the
wits
how
now

whither
wander
you

naught
now

this
knight
swearing
by
his
honour

charles
in
a
moment
threw
him
and
broke
three
of

lie
the
poor
old

counsel

leave
this
place
albeit
you
have
deserved
high
commendation
true
applause
and
love
yet
such
is
now
the
duke
s
condition
that
he
misconstrues
all
that
you
have
done
the
duke
is
humorous
what
he
is
indeed
more
suits
you
to
conceive
than
i
to
speak
of
orlando
i
thank
you
sir
and
pray

this
which
of
the
two
was
daughter

the
wrestling

neither
his
daughter
if
we
judge
by
manners
but
yet
indeed
the
lesser
is
his
daughter
the
other
is
daughter
to
the
banish
d
duke
and
here
detain
d
by
her
usurping
uncle
to
keep
his
daughter
company
whose
loves
are
dearer
than
the
natural
bond
of
sisters
but
i
can
tell
you
that
of
late
this
duke
hath
ta
en
displeasure
gainst
his
gentle
niece
grounded
upon
no
other
argument
but
that
the
people
praise
her
for
her
virtues
and
pity
her
for
her
good
father
s
sake
and
on
my
life
his
malice
gainst
the
lady
will
suddenly
break
forth

of

then
there
were
two

mad
without

celia

for

of

but
burs

in
time
in
despite
of
a
fall
but
turning
these
jests
out
of
service
let
us
talk
in
good
earnest
is
it
possible
on
such
a
sudden
you
should
fall
into
so
strong
a
liking
with
old
sir
rowland
s
youngest
son
rosalind
the
duke
my
father
loved
his
father
dearly
celia
doth
it
therefore
ensue
that
you
should
love
his
son
dearly
by
this
kind
of
chase
i
should
hate
him
for
my
father
hated
his
father
dearly
yet
i
hate
not
orlando
rosalind
no
faith
hate
him
not
for
my
sake
celia
why
should
i
not
doth
he
not
deserve
well
rosalind
let
me
love
him
for
that
and
do
you
love
him
because
i
do
look
here

full
of
anger

i
do
beseech

let
me
the
knowledge
of
my
fault
bear
with
me
if
with
myself
i
hold
intelligence
or
have
acquaintance
with
mine
own
desires
if
that
i
do
not
dream
or
be
not
frantic
as
i
do
trust
i
am
not
then
dear
uncle
never
so
much
as
in
a
thought
unborn
did
i
offend
your
highness
duke
frederick
thus
do
all
traitors
if
their
purgation
did
consist
in
words
they
are
as
innocent
as
grace
itself
let
it
suffice
thee
that
i
trust
thee
not
rosalind
yet
your
mistrust
cannot
make
me
a
traitor
tell
me
whereon
the
likelihood
depends
duke
frederick
thou
art
thy
father
s
daughter
there
s
enough

i
when
your
highness

your
pleasure

your

remorse
i
was
too

that
time
to
value
her
but
now
i

and
in

lie
there
what
hidden
woman

two
or
three
lords
like
foresters
duke
senior
now
my
co
mates
and
brothers
in
exile
hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
than
that
of
painted
pomp
are
not
these
woods
more
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
here
feel
we
but
the
penalty
of

the

difference
as
the
icy
fang

churlish
chiding
of
the

when
it
bites

blows
upon
my
body
even
till
i
shrink
with
cold
i
smile
and
say
this
is
no
flattery
these
are
counsellors
that
feelingly
persuade
me
what
i

sweet
are
the
uses
of
adversity
which
like
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
wears
yet
a
precious
jewel
in
his

and
this
our

exempt
from

that
can
translate
the
stubbornness
of
fortune
into
so
quiet

so
sweet
a
style
duke
senior
come
shall
we
go
and
kill
us
venison
and
yet
it
irks
me
the
poor
dappled
fools
being
native
burghers
of
this
desert
city
should
in
their
own
confines
with
forked
heads
have

gored

indeed
my

the
melancholy
jaques
grieves
at
that

in
that
kind
swears
you
do
more
usurp

doth
your

that
hath
banish
d
you
to
day
my
lord
of
amiens
and
myself
did
steal
behind
him
as
he
lay
along
under
an
oak
whose
antique
root
peeps
out
upon
the
brook
that
brawls
along
this
wood
to
the
which
place
a
poor
sequester
d
stag
that
from
the
hunter
s
aim
had
ta
en
a
hurt
did
come
to
languish
and
indeed
my
lord
the
wretched
animal
heaved
forth
such
groans
that
their
discharge
did
stretch
his
leathern
coat
almost
to
bursting
and
the
big
round
tears
coursed
one
another
down
his
innocent
nose
in
piteous
chase
and
thus
the
hairy
fool
much
marked
of
the
melancholy
jaques
stood
on
the
extremest
verge
of
the
swift
brook
augmenting
it
with
tears
duke
senior
but
what
said
jaques
did
he
not
moralize
this
spectacle
first
lord
o
yes
into
a
thousand
similes
first
for
his
weeping
into
the
needless
stream
poor
deer
quoth
he
thou
makest
a
testament
as
worldlings
do
giving
thy
sum
of
more
to
that
which
had
too
much
then
being
there
alone
left
and
abandon
d
of
his
velvet
friends
tis
right
quoth
he
thus
misery
doth
part
the
flux
of
company
anon
a
careless
herd
full
of
the
pasture
jumps
along
by
him
and
never
stays
to
greet
him
ay
quoth
jaques
sweep
on
you
fat
and
greasy
citizens
tis
just
the
fashion
wherefore
do
you
look
upon
that
poor
and
broken
bankrupt

thus
most
invectively

pierceth
through
the
body
of
the
country

and
of
this
our

swearing
that
we

a
fool
i
met
a
fool
i
the
forest
a
motley
fool
a
miserable
world
as
i
do
live
by
food
i
met
a
fool
who
laid
him
down
and
bask
d
him
in
the
sun
and
rail
d
on
lady
fortune
in
good
terms
in
good
set
terms
and
yet
a
motley
fool
good
morrow
fool
quoth
i
no
sir
quoth
he
call
me
not
fool
till
heaven
hath
sent
me
fortune
and
then
he
drew
a
dial
from
his
poke
and
looking
on
it
with
lack
lustre
eye
says
very
wisely
it
is
ten
o
clock
thus
we
may
see
quoth
he
how
the
world
wags
tis
but
an
hour
ago
since
it
was
nine
and
after
one
hour
more
twill
be
eleven
and
so
from
hour
to
hour
we
ripe
and
ripe
and
then
from
hour
to
hour
we
rot
and
rot
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
when
i
did
hear
the
motley
fool
thus
moral
on
the
time
my
lungs
began
to
crow
like
chanticleer
that
fools
should
be
so
deep
contemplative
and
i
did
laugh
sans
intermission
an
hour
by
his
dial
o
noble
fool
a
worthy
fool
motley
s
the
only
wear
duke
senior
what
fool
is
this
jaques
o
worthy
fool
one
that
hath
been
a
courtier
and
says
if
ladies
be
but
young
and
fair
they
have
the
gift
to
know
it
and
in
his
brain
which
is
as
dry
as
the
remainder
biscuit
after
a
voyage
he
hath
strange
places
cramm
d
with
observation
the
which
he
vents
in
mangled
forms
o
that
i
were
a
fool
i
am
ambitious
for
a
motley
coat
duke
senior
thou
shalt
have
one
jaques
it
is
my
only
suit
provided
that
you
weed
your
better
judgments
of
all
opinion
that
grows
rank
in
them
that
i
am
wise
i
must
have
liberty
withal
as
large
a
charter
as
the
wind
to
blow
on
whom
i
please
for
so
fools
have
and
they
that
are
most
galled
with
my
folly
they
most
must
laugh
and
why
sir
must
they
so
the
why
is
plain
as
way
to
parish
church
he
that
a
fool
doth
very
wisely
hit
doth
very
foolishly
although
he
smart
not

senseless

not

folly
is
anatomized

through

most
mischievous
foul

all
the
embossed

thou
with
licence
of

hast
caught

thou
seest
we
are
not
all
alone
unhappy
this
wide

universal
theatre

more
woeful
pageants

the
scene
wherein
we
play
in
jaques
all
the
world
s
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
his
acts
being
seven
ages
at
first
the
infant
mewling
and
puking
in
the
nurse
s
arms
and
then
the
whining
school
boy
with
his
satchel
and
shining
morning
face
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
school
and
then
the
lover
sighing
like
furnace
with
a
woeful
ballad
made
to
his
mistress
eyebrow
then
a
soldier
full
of
strange
oaths
and
bearded
like
the
pard
jealous
in
honour
sudden
and
quick
in
quarrel
seeking
the
bubble
reputation
even
in
the
cannon
s
mouth
and
then
the
justice
in
fair
round
belly
with
good
capon
lined
with
eyes
severe
and
beard
of
formal
cut
full
of
wise
saws
and
modern
instances
and
so
he
plays
his
part
the
sixth
age
shifts
into
the
lean
and
slipper
d
pantaloon
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
pouch
on
side
his
youthful
hose
well
saved
a
world
too
wide
for
his
shrunk
shank
and
his
big
manly
voice
turning
again
toward
childish
treble
pipes
and
whistles
in
his
sound
last
scene
of
all
that
ends
this
strange
eventful
history

second
childishness

mere
oblivion

in

that
it

it
is
naught
in

that
it
is

i

in

it
is

in

that
i

at

he
is

that
he
that
wants
money

three
good

that
the

of

is
to
wet

that
a
great
cause
of

is
lack

corin

those

hear
without
wondering
how
thy

answer
me
in
one
word

you
must
borrow
me
gargantua

tis
a
word
too
great
for
any
mouth
of
this
age
s
size
to
say
ay
and
no
to
these
particulars
is
more
than
to
answer
in
a
catechism
rosalind
but
doth
he
know
that
i
am
in
this
forest
and
in
man
s
apparel
looks
he
as
freshly
as
he
did
the
day
he
wrestled
celia
it
is
as
easy
to
count
atomies
as
to
resolve
the
propositions
of
a
lover
but
take
a
taste
of
my
finding
him
and
relish
it
with
good
observance
i
found
him
under
a
tree
like
a
dropped
acorn
rosalind
it
may
well
be
called
jove
s
tree
when
it
drops
forth
such
fruit
celia
give
me
audience
good
madam
rosalind
proceed
celia
there
lay
he
stretched
along
like
a
wounded
knight
rosalind
though
it
be
pity
to
see
such
a
sight
it
well
becomes
the
ground
celia
cry
holla
to
thy
tongue
i
prithee
it
curvets
unseasonably
he
was
furnished
like
a
hunter
rosalind
o
ominous

comes
to
kill
my
heart

would
sing
my
song
without
a
burden

do
you

am
a

painted

from
whence
you
have
studied
your
questions

sit
down
with
me
and
we
two
will
rail
against
our
mistress
the

chide
no
breather
in

myself
against

faults

the
worst
fault
you

is
to

a
fault

i
am

will
speak
to
him
like
a
saucy
lackey
and
under
that
habit
play
the
knave
with
him
do
you
hear
forester
orlando
very
well
what
would
you
rosalind
i
pray
you
what
is
t
o
clock
orlando
you
should
ask
me
what
time
o
day
there
s
no
clock
in
the
forest
rosalind
then
there
is
no
true
lover
in
the
forest
else
sighing
every
minute
and
groaning
every
hour
would
detect
the
lazy
foot
of
time
as
well
as
a
clock
orlando
and
why
not
the
swift
foot
of
time
had
not
that
been
as
proper
rosalind
by
no
means
sir
time
travels
in
divers
paces
with
divers
persons
i
ll
tell
you
who
time
ambles
withal
who
time
trots
withal
who
time
gallops
withal
and
who
he
stands
still
withal
orlando
i
prithee
who
doth
he
trot
withal
rosalind
marry
he
trots
hard
with
a
young
maid
between
the
contract
of
her
marriage
and
the
day
it
is
solemnized
if
the
interim
be
but
a
se
nnight
time
s
pace
is
so
hard
that
it
seems
the
length
of
seven
year
orlando
who
ambles
time
withal
rosalind
with
a
priest
that
lacks
latin
and
a
rich
man
that
hath
not
the
gout
for
the
one
sleeps
easily
because
he
cannot
study
and
the
other
lives
merrily
because
he
feels
no
pain
the
one
lacking
the
burden
of
lean
and
wasteful
learning
the
other
knowing
no
burden
of
heavy
tedious
penury
these
time
ambles
withal
orlando
who
doth
he
gallop
withal
rosalind
with
a
thief
to
the
gallows
for
though
he
go
as
softly
as
foot
can
fall
he
thinks
himself
too
soon
there
orlando
who
stays
it
still
withal
rosalind
with
lawyers
in
the
vacation
for
they
sleep
between
term
and
term
and
then
they
perceive
not
how
time
moves
orlando
where
dwell
you
pretty
youth
rosalind
with
this
shepherdess
my
sister
here
in
the
skirts
of
the
forest
like
fringe
upon
a
petticoat
orlando
are
you
native
of
this
place
rosalind
as
the
cony
that
you
see
dwell
where
she
is
kindled
orlando
your
accent
is
something
finer
than
you
could
purchase
in
so
removed
a
dwelling
rosalind
i
have
been
told
so
of
many
but
indeed
an
old
religious
uncle
of
mine
taught
me
to
speak
who
was
in
his
youth
an
inland
man
one
that
knew
courtship
too
well
for
there
he
fell
in
love
i
have
heard
him
read
many
lectures
against
it
and
i
thank
god
i
am
not
a
woman
to
be
touched
with
so
many
giddy
offences
as
he
hath
generally
taxed
their
whole
sex
withal
orlando
can
you
remember
any
of
the
principal
evils
that
he
laid
to
the
charge
of
women
rosalind
there
were
none
principal
they
were
all
like
one
another
as
half
pence
are
every
one
fault
seeming
monstrous
till
his
fellow
fault
came
to
match
it
orlando
i
prithee
recount
some
of
them
rosalind
no
i
will
not
cast
away
my
physic
but
on
those
that
are
sick
there
is
a
man
haunts
the
forest
that
abuses
our
young
plants
with
carving
rosalind
on
their
barks
hangs
odes
upon
hawthorns
and
elegies
on
brambles
all
forsooth
deifying
the
name
of
rosalind
if
i
could
meet
that
fancy
monger
i
would
give
him
some
good
counsel
for
he
seems
to
have
the
quotidian
of
love
upon
him
orlando
i
am
he
that
is
so
love
shaked
i
pray
you
tell
me
your
remedy
rosalind
there
is
none
of
my
uncle
s
marks
upon
you
he
taught
me
how
to
know
a
man
in
love
in
which
cage
of
rushes
i
am
sure
you
are
not
prisoner
orlando
what
were
his
marks
rosalind
a
lean
cheek
which
you
have
not
a
blue
eye
and
sunken
which
you
have
not
an
unquestionable
spirit
which
you
have
not
a
beard
neglected
which
you
have
not
but
i
pardon
you
for
that
for
simply
your
having
in
beard
is
a
younger
brother
s
revenue
then
your
hose
should
be
ungartered
your
bonnet
unbanded
your
sleeve
unbuttoned
your
shoe
untied
and
every
thing
about
you
demonstrating
a
careless
desolation
but
you
are
no
such
man
you
are
rather
point
device
in
your
accoutrements
as
loving
yourself
than
seeming
the
lover
of
any
other
orlando
fair
youth
i
would
i
could
make
thee
believe
i
love
rosalind
me
believe
it
you
may
as
soon
make
her
that
you
love
believe
it
which
i
warrant
she
is
apter
to
do
than
to
confess
she
does
that
is
one
of
the
points
in
the
which
women
still
give
the
lie
to
their
consciences
but
in
good
sooth
are
you
he
that
hangs
the
verses
on
the
trees
wherein
rosalind
is
so
admired
orlando
i
swear
to
thee
youth
by
the
white
hand
of
rosalind
i
am
that
he
that
unfortunate
he
rosalind
but
are
you
so
much
in
love
as
your
rhymes
speak
orlando
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
can
express
how
much
rosalind
love
is
merely
a
madness
and
i
tell
you
deserves
as
well
a
dark
house
and
a
whip
as
madmen
do
and
the
reason
why
they
are
not
so
punished
and
cured
is
that
the
lunacy
is
so
ordinary
that
the
whippers
are
in
love
too
yet
i
profess
curing
it
by
counsel
orlando
did
you
ever
cure
any
so
rosalind
yes
one
and
in
this
manner
he
was
to
imagine
me
his
love
his
mistress
and
i
set
him
every
day
to
woo
me
at
which
time
would
i
being
but
a
moonish
youth
grieve
be
effeminate
changeable
longing
and
liking
proud
fantastical
apish
shallow
inconstant
full
of
tears
full
of
smiles
for
every
passion
something
and
for
no
passion
truly
any
thing
as
boys
and
women
are
for
the
most
part
cattle
of
this
colour
would
now
like
him
now
loathe
him
then
entertain
him
then
forswear
him
now
weep
for
him
then
spit
at
him
that
i
drave
my
suitor
from
his
mad
humour
of
love
to
a
living
humour
of
madness
which
was
to
forswear
the
full
stream
of
the
world
and
to
live
in
a
nook
merely
monastic
and
thus
i
cured
him
and
this
way
will
i
take
upon
me
to
wash
your
liver
as
clean
as
a
sound
sheep
s
heart
that
there
shall
not
be
one
spot
of
love
in
t
orlando
i
would
not
be
cured
youth
rosalind
i
would
cure
you
if
you
would
but
call
me
rosalind
and
come
every
day
to
my
cote
and
woo
me
orlando
now
by
the
faith
of
my
love
i
will
tell
me
where
it
is
rosalind
go
with
me
to
it
and
i
ll
show
it
you
and
by
the
way
you
shall
tell
me
where
in
the
forest
you
live
will
you
go
orlando
with
all
my
heart
good
youth
rosalind

call

amen
a

may
if

were
of
a
fearful
heart
stagger
in
this
attempt
for
here
we
have
no
temple
but
the
wood
no
assembly
but
horn
beasts
but
what
though
c
ourage
as
horns
are
odious
they
are
necessary
it
is
said
many
a
man
knows
no
end
of
his
goods
right
many
a
man
has
good
horns
and
knows
no
end
of
them
well
that
is
the
dowry
of
his
wife
tis
none
of
his
own
getting
horns
even
so
poor
men
alone
no
no
the
noblest
deer
hath
them
as
huge
as
the
rascal
is
the
single
man
therefore
blessed
no
as
a
walled
town
is
more
worthier
than
a
village
so
is
the
forehead
of
a
married
man
more
honourable
than
the
bare
brow
of
a
bachelor
and
by
how
much
defence
is
better
than
no
skill
by
so
much
is
a
horn
more
precious
than
to
want
here

i

i

for
he
is
not
like
to
marry
me

will
be
a
good

audrey
sir

martext
tis
no

ne

a
fantastical
knave
of

all
shall
flout
me
out
of
my
calling
exit
scene
iv
the
forest
enter
rosalind
and
celia
rosalind
never
talk
to
me
i
will
weep
celia
do
i
prithee
but
yet
have
the
grace
to
consider
that
tears
do
not
become
a
man
rosalind
but
have
i
not
cause
to
weep
celia
as
good
cause
as
one
would
desire
therefore
weep
rosalind
his
very
hair
is
of
the
dissembling
colour
celia
something
browner
than
judas
s
marry
his
kisses
are
judas
s
own
children
rosalind
i
faith
his
hair
is
of
a
good
colour
celia
an
excellent
colour
your
chestnut
was
ever
the
only
colour
rosalind
and
his
kissing
is
as
full
of
sanctity
as
the
touch
of
holy
bread
celia
he
hath
bought
a
pair
of
cast
lips
of
diana
a
nun
of
winter
s
sisterhood
kisses
not
more
religiously
the
very
ice
of
chastity
is
in
them
rosalind
but
why
did
he
swear
he
would
come
this
morning
and
comes
not
celia
nay
certainly
there
is
no
truth
in
him
rosalind
do
you
think
so
celia
yes
i
think
he
is
not
a
pick
purse
nor
a
horse
stealer
but
for
his
verity
in
love
i
do
think
him
as
concave
as
a
covered
goblet
or
a
worm
eaten
nut
rosalind
not
true
in
love
celia
yes
when
he
is
in
but
i
think
he
is
not
in
rosalind
you
have
heard
him
swear
downright
he
was
celia
was
is
not
is
besides
the
oath
of
a
lover
is
no
stronger
than
the
word
of
a
tapster
they
are
both
the
confirmer
of
false
reckonings
he
attends
here
in
the
forest
on
the
duke
your
father
rosalind
i
met
the
duke
yesterday
and
had
much
question
with
him
he
asked
me
of
what
parentage
i
was
i
told
him
of
as
good
as
he
so
he
laughed
and
let
me
go
but
what
talk
we
of
fathers
when
there
is
such
a
man
as
orlando
celia
o
that
s
a
brave
man
he
writes
brave
verses
speaks
brave
words
swears
brave
oaths
and
breaks
them
bravely
quite
traverse
athwart
the
heart
of
his
lover
as
a
puisny
tilter
that
spurs
his
horse
but
on
one
side
breaks
his
staff
like
a
noble
goose
but
all
s
brave
that
youth
mounts
and
folly
guides
who
comes
here
enter
corin
corin

and
master
you
have
oft
inquired
after
the
shepherd
that
complain

who
you
saw
sitting
by
me
on
the
turf
praising
the
proud
disdainful
shepherdess
that
was
his
mistress
celia
well
and
what
of
him
corin
if
you
will
see
a
pageant
truly
play

between
the
pale
complexion
of

disdain
go

little
and

do

that
you

but
say
not
so
in
bitterness
the
common
executioner
whose
heart
the
accustom
d

of
death
makes

falls
not
the

thou
tell
st
me
there
is
murder
in
mine
eye
tis
pretty
sure
and
very
probable
that
eyes
that
are
the
frail
st
and
softest
things
who
shut
their
coward
gates
on
atomies
should
be
call
d

murderers
now
i
do
frown
on
thee
with
all
my
heart
and
if
mine
eyes
can
wound
now
let
them
kill
thee
now
counterfeit
to
swoon
why
now
fall
down
or
if
thou
canst
not
o
for
shame
for
shame
lie
not
to
say
mine
eyes
are
murderers
now
show
the
wound
mine
eye
hath
made
in
thee
scratch
thee
but
with
a
pin
and
there
remains
some
scar
of
it
lean
but
upon
a
rush
the
cicatrice
and
capable
impressure
thy
palm
some
moment
keeps
but
now
mine
eyes
which
i
have
darted
at
thee
hurt
thee
not
nor
i
am
sure
there
is
no
force
in
eyes
that
can
do
hurt
silvius
o
dear
phebe
if
ever
as
that
ever
may
be
near
you
meet
in
some
fresh
cheek
the
power
of
fancy
then
shall
you
know
the
wounds
invisible
that
love
s
keen
arrows
make
phebe
but
till
that
time
come
not
thou
near
me
and
when
that
time
comes
afflict
me
with
thy
mocks
pity
me
not
as
till
that
time
i
shall
not
pity
thee
rosalind
and
why
i
pray
you
who
might
be
your
mother
that
you
insult
exult
and
all
at
once
over
the
wretched
what
though
you
have
no

as
by
my
faith
i

no
more
in

you
be
therefore
proud

pitiless
why
what

why
do
you

no
more
in
you
than
in
the
ordinary
of

work
od

my
little
life
i
think
she
means
to
tangle
my
eyes

tis
not
your
inky
brows
your
black
silk
hair
your
bugle
eyeballs
nor
your
cheek
of
cream
that
can
entame
my
spirits
to

wherefore
do
you
follow
her

you
that
flatters
her
and
out
of

she
sees
herself
more
proper
than
any
of
her
lineaments
can
show
her
but

by

your

were
covetousness
silvius
the
time
was
that
i
hated
thee
and
yet
it
is
not
that
i
bear

but
since
that
thou
canst
talk
of
love
so
well
thy
company
which
erst
was
irksome
to
me
i
will
endure
and
i
ll
employ
thee

but
do
not

than
thine

gladness
that
thou
art
employ
d
silvius
so
holy
and
so
perfect
is
my
love
and
i
in
such
a
poverty
of
grace
that
i
shall
think
it
a
most
plenteous
crop
to
glean
the
broken
ears
after
the
man
that
the
main
harvest
reaps
loose
now
and
then
a
scatter
d
smile
and
that
i
ll
live
upon
phebe
know
st
now
the
youth
that
spoke
to
me
erewhile
silvius
not
very
well
but
i
have
met
him
oft
and
he
hath
bought
the
cottage
and
the
bounds
that
the
old
carlot
once
was
master
of
phebe
think
not
i
love
him
though
i
ask
for
him
tis
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
but
what
care
i
for
words
yet
words
do
well
when
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
it
is
a
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
but
sure
he
s
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
he
ll
make
a
proper
man
the
best
thing
in
him
is
his
complexion
and
faster
than
his
tongue
did
make
offence
his
eye
did
heal
it
up
he
is
not
very
tall
yet
for
his
years
he
s
tall
his
leg
is
but
so
so
and
yet
tis
well
there
was
a
pretty
redness
in
his
lip
a
little
riper
and
more
lusty
red
than
that
mix
d
in
his
cheek
twas
just
the
difference
between
the
constant
red
and
mingled
damask
there
be
some
women
silvius
had
they
mark
d
him
in
parcels
as
i
did
would
have
gone
near
to
fall
in
love
with
him
but
for
my
part
i
love
him
not
nor
hate
him
not
and
yet
i
have
more
cause
to
hate
him
than
to
love
him
for
what
had
he
to
do
to
chide
at
me
he
said
mine
eyes
were
black
and
my
hair
black
and
now
i
am
remember
d
scorn
d
at
me
i
marvel
why
i
answer
d
not
again
but
that
s
all
one
omittance
is
no
quittance
i
ll
write
to
him
a
very
taunting
letter
and
thou
shalt
bear
it
wilt
thou
silvius
silvius
phebe
with
all
my
heart
phebe
i
ll
write
it
straight
the
matter
s
in
my
head
and
in
my
heart
i
will
be
bitter
with
him
and
passing
short
go

jaques
i
prithee
pretty
youth
let
me
be
better
acquainted
with
thee
rosalind
they
say
you
are
a
melancholy
fellow
jaques
i
am
so
i
do
love
it
better
than
laughing
rosalind
those
that
are
in
extremity
of
either
are
abominable
fellows
and
betray
themselves
to
every
modern
censure
worse
than
drunkards
jaques
why
tis
good
to
be
sad
and
say
nothing
rosalind
why
then
tis
good
to
be
a
post
jaques
i
have
neither
the
scholar
s
melancholy
which
is
emulation
nor
the
musician
s
which
is
fantastical
nor
the
courtier
s
which
is
proud
nor
the
soldier
s
which
is
ambitious
nor
the
lawyer
s
which
is
politic
nor
the
lady
s
which
is
nice
nor
the
lover
s
which
is
all
these
but
it
is
a
melancholy
of
mine
own
compounded
of
many
simples
extracted
from
many
objects
and
indeed
the
sundry
s
contemplation
of
my
travels
in
which
my
often
rumination
wraps
me
m
a
most
humorous
sadness
rosalind
a
traveller
by
my
faith
you
have
great
reason
to
be
sad
i
fear
you
have
sold
your
own
lands
to
see
other
men
s
then
to
have
seen
much
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
have
rich
eyes
and
poor
hands
jaques

i
have
gained
my
experience
rosalind
and
your
experience
makes
you
sad
i
had
rather
have
a
fool

make
me
merry
than
experience
to
make
me
sad
and
to
travel
for
it
too
enter
orlando

of
a
snail
for
though
he
comes
slowly
he
carries
his
house
on
his
head

better
jointure

think
than
you
make
a
woman
besides
he
brings
his
destiny
with
him
orlando
what
s
that
rosalind
why
horns
which
such
as
you
are
fain
to
be
beholding
to
your
wives
for
but
he
comes
armed
in
his
fortune
and
prevents
the
slander
of
his
wife
orlando
virtue
is
no
horn
maker
and
my
rosalind
is
virtuous
rosalind
and
i
am
your
rosalind
celia
it
pleases
him
to
call
you
so
but
he
hath
a
rosalind
of
a
better
leer
than
you
rosalind

me
woo
me
for
now
i
am
in
a
holiday
humour
and
like

you
say
to
me
now
an
i
were
your
very
very
rosalind
orlando
i
would
kiss
before
i
spoke
rosalind
nay
you
were
better
speak
first
and
when
you
were
gravelled
for
lack
of
matter
you
might
take
occasion
to
kiss
very
good
orators
when
they
are
out
they
will
spit
and
for
lovers
lacking
god
warn
us
matter
the
cleanliest
shift
is
to
kiss
orlando
how
if
the
kiss
be
denied
rosalind
then
she
puts
you
to
entreaty
and
there
begins
new
matter
orlando
who
could
be
out
being
before
his
beloved
mistress
rosalind
marry
that
should
you
if
i
were
your
mistress
or
i
should
think
my
honesty
ranker
than
my
wit
orlando
what
of
my
suit

not
out
of
your
apparel
and
yet
out
of
your
suit
am
not
i
your
rosalind
orlando
i
take
some
joy
to
say

because
i
would
be
talking
of

rosalind
well
in
her

i
say
i
will
not
have
you
orlando
then
in
mine

person
i
die

the
poor
world

almost
six
thousand
years
old
and
in
all
this
time
there
was
not
any
man
died
in
his
own
person
videlicit
in
a
love
cause
troilus
had
his
brains
dashed
out
with
a
grecian
club
yet
he
did
what
he
could
to
die
before
and
he
is
one
of
the
patterns
of
love
leander
he
would
have
lived
many
a
fair
year
though
hero
had
turned
nun
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
hot
midsummer
night
for
good
youth
he
went
but
forth
to
wash
him
in
the
hellespont
and
being
taken
with
the
cramp
was
drowned
and
the
foolish
coroners
of
that
age
found
it
was
hero
of
sestos
but
these
are
all
lies
men
have
died
from
time
to
time
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
orlando
i
would
not
have
my
right
rosalind
of
this
mind
for
i
protest
her
frown

kill
me
rosalind

this
hand

a
girl

so
do
all

are
winged
rosalind
now

barbary
cock
pigeon
over

hen
more
clamorous

parrot
against

more
new
fangled

ape
more
giddy
in

desires

a
monkey
i
will
weep
for
nothing

diana
in

fountain
and
i
will
do
that
when
you
are
disposed
to
be
merry
i
will
laugh
like
a
hyen
and
that
when
thou
art
inclined

rosalind
do

rosalind
by

do
orlando

could
not
have
the
wit
to
do
this
the
wiser
the
waywarder
make

shut

out

key
hole
stop
that

fly

smoke
out

orlando
a
man

a

with
such
a
wit
he
might
say

you
might
keep
that
cheque
for

till
you
met
your

wit
going
to
your
neighbour

bed
orlando
and
what
wit
could

rosalind
marry

say
she
came
to
seek
you
there
you
shall
never
take
her
without
her
answer
unless
you
take
her
without
her
tongue

cannot
make

fault
her

rosalind
rosalind

so
god

all
pretty
oaths
that
are
not
dangerous
if
you
break
one
jot
of
your
promise
or
come
one
minute
behind
your
hour
i
will
think
you
the
most
pathetical
break
promise
and
the
most
hollow
lover
and
the
most
unworthy
of
her
you
call
rosalind
that
may
be
chosen
out
of
the
gross
band
of
the
unfaithful
therefore
beware
my
censure

keep
your
promise
orlando
with
no
less
religion
than
if
thou
wert
indeed
my
rosalind
so
adieu

all
such
offenders

simply
misused

my
affection

an
unknown
bottom

the
bay
of
portugal
celia
or
rather
bottomless

as
fast

affection
in

that

wicked
bastard
of

silvius
my
errand
is
to
you
fair
youth
my
gentle
phebe
bid
me
give
you
this
i
know
not
the
contents
but
as
i
guess
by
the
stern
brow
and
waspish
action
which
she
did
use
as
she
was
writing
of
it
it
bears
an
angry
tenor
pardon
me
i
am
but
as
a
guiltless
messenger
rosalind
patience
herself
would
startle
at
this
letter
and
play
the
swaggerer
bear
this
bear
all
she
says
i
am
not
fair
that
i
lack
manners
she
calls
me
proud
and
that
she
could
not
love
me
were
man
as
rare
as
phoenix
od
s
my
will
her
love
is
not
the
hare
that
i
do
hunt
why
writes
she
so
to
me
well
shepherd
well
this
is
a
letter
of
your
own
device
silvius
no
i
protest
i
know
not
the
contents
phebe
did
write
it
rosalind
come
come
you
are
a
fool
and
turn
d
into
the
extremity
of
love
i
saw
her
hand
she
has
a
leathern
hand
a
freestone
colour
d
hand
i
verily
did
think
that
her
old
gloves
were
on
but
twas
her
hands
she
has
a
huswife
s
hand
but
that
s
no
matter
i
say
she
never
did
invent
this
letter
this
is
a
man
s
invention
and
his
hand
silvius
sure
it
is
hers
rosalind
why
tis
a
boisterous
and
a
cruel
style
a
style
for
challengers
why
she
defies
me
like
turk
to
christian
women
s
gentle
brain
could
not
drop
forth
such
giant
rude
invention
such
ethiope
words
blacker
in
their
effect
than
in
their
countenance
will
you
hear
the
letter
silvius
so
please
you
for
i
never
heard
it
yet
yet
heard
too
much
of
phebe
s
cruelty
rosalind
she
phebes
me
mark
how
the
tyrant
writes
reads
art
thou
god
to

d
that
a
maiden

heart
hath
burn
d
can
a
woman
rail
thus

you
this
railing
rosalind
[reads]
why
thy
godhead
laid
apart
warr
st
thou
with
a
woman
s
heart
did
you
ever
hear
such
railing
whiles
the
eye
of
man
did
woo
me
that
could
do
no
vengeance
to
me
meaning
me
a
beast
if
the
scorn
of
your
bright
eyne
have
power
to
raise
such
love
in
mine
alack
in
me
what
strange
effect
would
they
work
in
mild
aspect
whiles
you
chid
me
i
did
love
how
then
might
your
prayers
move
he
that
brings
this
love
to
thee
little
knows
this
love
in
me
and
by
him
seal
up
thy
mind
whether
that
thy
youth
and
kind
will
the
faithful
offer
take
of
me
and
all
that
i
can
make
or
else
by

to

we
understand
by
this
oliver
some
of
my
shame
if
you
will
know
of
me
what
man
i
am
and
how
and
why
and
where
this
handkercher
was
stain
d
celia
i
pray
you
tell
it
oliver
when
last
the
young
orlando
parted
from
you
he
left
a
promise
to
return
again
within
an
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
chewing
the
food
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
lo
what
befell
he
threw
his
eye
aside
and
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
under
an
oak
whose
boughs
were
moss
d
with
age
and
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
a
wretched
ragged
man
o
ergrown
with
hair
lay
sleeping
on
his
back
about
his
neck
a
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreathed
itself
who
with
her
head
nimble
in
threats
approach
d
the
opening
of
his
mouth
but
suddenly
seeing
orlando
it
unlink
d
itself
and
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
into
a
bush
under
which
bush
s
shade
a
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
lay
couching
head
on
ground
with
catlike
watch
when
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
the
royal
disposition
of
that
beast
to
prey
on
nothing
that
doth
seem
as
dead
this
seen
orlando
did
approach
the
man
and
found
it
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
celia
o
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
that
same
brother
and
he
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
that
lived
amongst
men
oliver
and
well
he
might
so
do
for
well
i
know
he
was
unnatural
rosalind
but
to
orlando
did
he
leave
him
there
food
to
the
suck
d
and
hungry
lioness
oliver
twice
did
he
turn
his
back
and
purposed
so
but
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
and
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
made
him
give
battle
to
the
lioness
who
quickly
fell
before
him
in
which
hurtling
from
miserable
slumber
i
awaked
celia
are
you
his
brother
rosalind
wast
you
he
rescued

t
you
that
did
so
oft
contrive

kill
him

kindly
bathed

he
led
me
to
the
gentle
duke
who
gave
me
fresh
array
and
entertainment
committing
me
unto
my
brother
s
love
who
led
me
instantly
unto
his
cave
there
stripp
d
himself
and
here
upon
his
arm
the
lioness
had
torn
some
flesh
away
which
all
this
while
had
bled
and
now
he
fainted
and
cried
in
fainting
upon
rosalind
brief
i

up
his
wound
and
after
some
small
space
being
strong
at
heart
he
sent
me
hither
stranger
as
i
am
to
tell
this
story
that
you
might
excuse
his
broken
promise

in

a
good
opinion

i
say
i
know
you

little
measure
draw
a
belief
from
you
to
do
yourself
good
and
not
to
grace
me
believe
then
if
you

strange
things

have
since
i
was
three
year
old
conversed
with
a
magician
most
profound
in
his
art
and
yet
not
damnable
if
you
do
love
rosalind
so
near
the
heart
as
your
gesture
cries
it
out
when
your
brother
marries
aliena
shall
you
marry
her
i
know
into
what
straits
of
fortune
she
is
driven
and
it
is
not
impossible
to
me
if
it
appear
not
inconvenient
to
you
to
set
her
before
your
eyes
tomorrow
human
as
she
is
and
without
any
danger
orlando

thou
in
sober
meanings

forest
born
and
hath
been
tutor
d
in
the
rudiments
of
many
desperate
studies
by
his
uncle
whom
he
reports
to
be
a
great
magician
obscured
in
the
circle
of
this
forest
enter
touchstone
and
audrey
jaques
there
is
sure
another
flood
toward
and
these
couples
are
coming
to
the
ark
here
comes
a
pair
of
very
strange
beasts
which
in
all
tongues
are
called
fools
touchstone
salutation
and
greeting
to
you
all
jaques
good
my
lord
bid
him
welcome
this
is
the
motley
minded
gentleman
that
i
have
so
often
met
in
the
forest
he
hath
been
a
courtier
he
swears
touchstone
if
any
man
doubt
that
let
him
put
me
to
my
purgation
i
have
trod
a
measure
i
have
flattered
a
lady
i
have
been
politic
with
my
friend
smooth
with
mine
enemy
i
have
undone
three
tailors
i
have
had
four
quarrels
and
like
to
have
fought
one
jaques
and
how
was
that
ta
en
up
touchstone
faith
we
met
and
found
the
quarrel
was
upon
the
seventh
cause
jaques
how
seventh
cause
good
my
lord
like
this
fellow
duke
senior
i
like
him
very
well
touchstone
god
ild
you
sir
i
desire
you
of
the
like
i
press
in
here
sir
amongst
the
rest
of
the
country
copulatives
to
swear
and
to
forswear
according
as
marriage
binds
and
blood
breaks
a
poor
virgin
sir
an
ill
favoured
thing
sir
but
mine
own
a
poor
humour
of
mine
sir
to
take
that
that
no
man
else
will
rich
honesty
dwells
like
a
miser
sir
in
a
poor
house
as
your
pearl
in
your
foul
oyster
duke
senior
by
my
faith
he
is
very
swift
and
sententious
touchstone
according
to
the
fool
s
bolt
sir
and
such
dulcet
diseases
jaques
but
for
the
seventh
cause
how
did
you
find
the
quarrel
on
the
seventh
cause
touchstone
upon
a
lie
seven
times
removed
bear
your
body
more
seeming
audrey
as
thus
sir
i
did
dislike
the
cut
of
a
certain
courtier
s
beard
he
sent
me
word
if
i
said
his
beard
was
not
cut
well
he
was
in
the
mind
it
was
this
is
called
the
retort
courteous
if
i
sent
him
word
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
send
me
word
he
cut
it
to
please
himself
this
is
called
the
quip
modest
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
disabled
my
judgment
this
is
called
the
reply
churlish
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
answer
i
spake
not
true
this
is
called
the
reproof
valiant
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
say
i
lied
this
is
called
the
counter
cheque
quarrelsome
and
so
to
the
lie
circumstantial
and
the
lie
direct
jaques
and
how
oft
did
you
say
his
beard
was
not
well
cut
touchstone
i
durst
go
no
further
than
the
lie
circumstantial
nor
he
durst
not
give
me
the
lie
direct
and
so
we
measured
swords
and
parted
jaques
can
you
nominate
in
order
now
the
degrees
of
the
lie
touchstone
o
sir
we
quarrel
in
print
by
the
book
as
you
have
books
for
good
manners
i
will
name
you
the
degrees
the
first
the
retort
courteous
the
second
the
quip
modest
the
third
the
reply
churlish
the
fourth
the
reproof
valiant
the
fifth
the
countercheque
quarrelsome
the
sixth
the
lie
with
circumstance
the
seventh
the
lie
direct
all
these
you
may
avoid
but
the
lie
direct
and
you
may
avoid
that
too
with
an
if
i
knew
when
seven
justices
could
not
take
up
a
quarrel
but
when
the
parties
were
met
themselves
one
of
them
thought
but
of
an
if
as
if
you
said
so
then
i
said
so
and
they
shook
hands
and
swore
brothers
your
if
is
the
only
peacemaker
much
virtue
in
if
jaques
is
not
this
a
rare
fellow
my
lord

s
as
good

to

to
the
skirts
of
this
wild
wood
he
came
where
meeting
with
an
old
religious
man
after
some
question
with

converted

from
the
world

it
is
not
the
fashion
to
see
the
lady
the
epilogue
but
it
is
no
more
unhandsome
than
to
see
the
lord
the
prologue
if
it
be
true
that
good
wine
needs
no
bush
tis
true
that
a
good
play
needs
no
epilogue
yet

good
wine
they
do
use
good
bushes
and
good
plays
prove
the
better

the
help
of

epilogues

a
case

in

neither
a

epilogue
nor
cannot
insinuate

of
a
good

i
am
not
furnished
like
a
beggar

to
beg
will
not
become

way
is
to
conjure
you

ll
begin
with
the
women
i
charge
you
o
women
for
the
love
you
bear
to

to
like
as
much
of
this
play
as
please
you
and
i
charge
you
o
men
for
the
love
you
bear
to
women
as
i
perceive
by
your
simpering
none
of
you
hates
them
that
between
you
and
the
women
the
play
may
please
if
i
were
a
woman
i
would
kiss
as
many
of
you
as
had
beards
that
pleased
me
complexions
that
liked
me
and
breaths
that
i
defied
not
and
i
am
sure
as
many
as
have
good
beards
or
good
faces
or
sweet
breaths
will
for
my
kind
offer
when
i
make
curtsy
bid
me
farewell
