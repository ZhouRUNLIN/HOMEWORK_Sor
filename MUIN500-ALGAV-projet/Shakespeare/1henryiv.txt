earl
of
westmoreland
sir
walter
blunt
and
others
king
henry
iv
so
shaken
as
we
are
so
wan
with
care
find
we
a
time
for
frighted
peace
to
pant
and
breathe
short
winded
accents
of
new
broils
to
be
commenced
in
strands
afar
remote
no
more
the
thirsty
entrance
of
this
soil
shall
daub
her
lips
with
her
own
children
s
blood
nor
more
shall
trenching
war
channel
her
fields
nor
bruise
her
flowerets
with
the
armed
hoofs
of
hostile
paces
those
opposed
eyes
which
like
the
meteors
of
a
troubled
heaven
all
of
one
nature
of
one
substance
bred
did
lately
meet
in
the
intestine
shock
and
furious
close
of
civil
butchery
shall
now
in
mutual
well
beseeming
ranks
march
all
one
way
and
be
no
more
opposed
against
acquaintance
kindred
and
allies
the
edge
of
war
like
an
ill
sheathed
knife
no
more
shall
cut
his
master
therefore
friends
as
far
as
to
the
sepulchre
of
christ
whose
soldier
now
under
whose
blessed
cross
we
are
impressed
and
engaged
to
fight
forthwith
a
power
of
english
shall
we
levy
whose
arms
were
moulded
in
their
mothers
womb
to
chase
these
pagans
in
those
holy
fields
over
whose
acres
walk
d
those
blessed
feet
which
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
were
nail
d
for
our
advantage
on
the
bitter
cross
but
this
our
purpose
now
is
twelve
month
old
and
bootless
tis
to
tell
you
we
will
go
therefore
we
meet
not
now
then
let
me
hear
of
you
my
gentle
cousin
westmoreland
what
yesternight
our
council
did
decree
in
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
westmoreland
my
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wild
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shameless
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
king
henry
iv
it
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
brake
off
our
business
for
the
holy
land
westmoreland
this
match
d
with
other
did
my
gracious
lord
for
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
came
from
the
north
and
thus
it
did
import
on
holy
rood
day
the
gallant
hotspur
there
young
harry
percy
and
brave
archibald
that
ever
valiant
and
approved
scot
at
holmedon
met
where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
as
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
and
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
for
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
and
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way
king
henry
iv
here
is
a
dear
a
true
industrious
friend
sir
walter
blunt
new
lighted
from
his
horse
stain
d
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
betwixt
that
holmedon
and
this
seat
of
ours
and
he
hath
brought
us
smooth
and
welcome
news
the
earl
of
douglas
is
discomfited
ten
thousand
bold
scots
two
and
twenty
knights
balk
d
in
their
own
blood
did
sir

see
on
holmedon

plains

earl
of
fife
and
eldest
son
to
beaten
douglas
and
the
earl
of
athol
of
murray
angus
and
menteith
and
is
not
this
an
honourable
spoil
a
gallant
prize
ha
cousin
is
it
not
westmoreland
in
faith
it
is
a
conquest
for
a
prince
to
boast
of
king
henry
iv
yea
there
thou
makest
me
sad
and
makest
me
sin
in
envy
that
my
lord
northumberland
should
be
the
father
to
so
blest
a
son
a
son
who
is
the
theme
of
honour
s
tongue
amongst
a
grove
the
very
straightest
plant
who
is
sweet
fortune
s
minion
and
her
pride
whilst
i
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
see
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
of
my
young
harry
o
that
it
could
be
proved
that
some
night
tripping
fairy
had
exchanged
in
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
and
call
d
mine
percy
his
plantagenet
then
would
i
have
his
harry
and
he
mine
but
let
him
from
my
thoughts
what
think
you
coz
of
this
young
percy
s
pride
the
prisoners
which
he
in
this
adventure
hath
surprised
to
his
own
use
he
keeps
and
sends
me
word
i
shall
have
none
but
mordake
earl
of
fife
westmoreland
this
is
his
uncle
s
teaching
this
is
worcester
malevolent
to
you
in
all
aspects
which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
the
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity
king
henry
iv
but
i
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
and
for
this
cause
awhile
we
must
neglect
our
holy
purpose
to
jerusalem
cousin
on
wednesday
next
our
council
we
will
hold
at
windsor
so
inform
the
lords
but
come

with
speed
to
us

wouldst
truly
know
what
a
devil
hast

my
good
sweet
honey

i
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
i
cannot
manage
alone
falstaff
bardolph
peto
and
gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
i
will
not
be
there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
i
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
prince
henry
how
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
poins
why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
we
ll
set
upon
them
prince
henry
yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
poins
tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
i
ll
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
vizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
i
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
prince
henry
yea
but
i
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
poins
well
for
two
of
them
i
know
them
to
be
as
true
bred
cowards
as
ever
turned
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
i
ll
forswear
arms
the
virtue
of
this
jest
will
be
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
prince
henry
well
i
ll
go
with
thee
provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
to
morrow
night
in
eastcheap
there
i
ll
sup
farewell

farewell
my
lord
exit
poins
prince
henry
i
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
the
unyoked
humour
of
your
idleness
yet
herein
will
i
imitate
the
sun
who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
to
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
that
when
he
please
again
to
be
himself
being
wanted

guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my

hotspur
my
liege
i
did
deny
no

i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toil
breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dress
d
fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
reap
d
show
d
like
a
stubble
land
at
harvest
home
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
twixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
a
pouncet
box
which
ever
and
anon
he
gave
his
nose
and
took
t
away
again
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smiled
and
talk
d
and
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
he
call
d
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
to
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corse
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
he
question
d
me
amongst
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your

i
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
pester
d
with
a
popinjay
out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
answer
d
neglectingly
i
know
not
what
he
should
or
he
should
not

he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talk
so
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
of
guns
and
drums
and
wounds
god
save
the
mark
and
telling
me
the
sovereign
st
thing
on

was
parmaceti
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was

villanous
salt
petre
should
be

d
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
destroy
d
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
guns
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
this
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
i
answer
d
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you

not
his

reasonably
die

with
proviso
and
exception
that
we
at

own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
his
brother

foolish
mortimer
who
on
my

hath
wilfully
betray

that
he
did
lead

against
that
great
magician

we

hath

never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign

by
the
chance
of
war
to
prove
that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
when
on
the
gentle
severn
s
sedgy
bank
in
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
he
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breathed
and
three
times
did
they
drink
upon
agreement
of
swift
severn
s
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
bloodstained
with
these
valiant
combatants
never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
could
the
noble

so
many

yea
on
his
part
i
ll
empty
all
these
veins
and
shed
my
dear
blood
drop
by
drop
in
the
dust
but
i
will
lift
the
down
trod
mortimer
as
high
in
the
air
as
this
unthankful
king
as
this
ingrate
and
canker
d
bolingbroke
northumberland
brother
the
king
hath
made
your
nephew
mad
earl
of
worcester
who
struck
this
heat
up
after
i
was
gone
hotspur
he
will
forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
and
when
i
urged
the
ransom
once
again
of
my
wife
s
brother
then
his
cheek
look
d
pale
and
on
my
face
he
turn
d
an
eye
of
death
trembling
even
at
the
name
of
mortimer
earl
of
worcester
i
cannot
blame
him
was
not
he
proclaim
d
by
richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
northumberland
he
was
i
heard
the
proclamation
and
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
king
whose
wrongs
in
us
god
pardon
did
set
forth
upon
his
irish
expedition
from
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
to
be
deposed
and
shortly
murdered
earl
of
worcester
and
for
whose
death
we
in
the
world
s
wide
mouth
live
scandalized
and
foully
spoken
of
hotspur
but
soft
i
pray
you
did
king
richard
then
proclaim
my
brother
edmund
mortimer
heir
to
the
crown
northumberland
he
did
myself
did
hear
it
hotspur
nay
then
i
cannot
blame
his
cousin
king
that
wished
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
but
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
and
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
of
murderous
subornation
shall
it
be
that
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
the
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
o
pardon
me
that
i
descend
so
low
to
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
wherein
you
range
under
this
subtle
king
shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
that
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
did
gage
them
both
in
an
unjust
behalf
as
both
of
you
god
pardon
it
have
done
to
put
down
richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
an
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
bolingbroke
and
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
that
you
are
fool
d
discarded
and
shook
off
by
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
no
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
your
banish
d
honours
and
restore
yourselves
into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
revenge
the
jeering
and
disdain
d
contempt
of
this
proud
king
who
studies
day
and
night
to
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
therefore
i
say
earl
of
worcester
peace
cousin
say
no
more
and
now
i
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
and
to
your
quick
conceiving
discontents
i
ll
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
as
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
as
to
o
er
walk
a
current
roaring
loud
on
the
unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
hotspur
if
he
fall
in
good
night
or
sink
or
swim
send
danger
from
the
east
unto
the
west
so
honour
cross
it
from
the
north
to
south
and
let
them
grapple
o
the
blood
more
stirs
to
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
northumberland
imagination
of
some
great
exploit
drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
hotspur
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
pale
faced
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
fathom
line
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
so
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
without
corrival
all
her
dignities
but
out
upon
this
half
faced
fellowship
earl
of
worcester
he
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here
but
not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend
good
cousin
give
me
audience
for
a
while

of

scot

unto
my
purposes

will
find
him
when

lies
asleep
and

his
ear
i

nay
i
ll
have
a
starling

sooner
it

that
thou
art
my

i
have
partly
thy

s
word
partly
my
own
opinion
but
chiefly
a
villanous
trick
of
thine
eye
and
a
foolish
hanging
of
thy
nether
lip
that
doth
warrant
me
if
then
thou
be

here
lies
the
point

so
pointed
at

prove
a
micher
and
eat
blackberries
a

shall
the

a
question

there
is
a

harry

thou
hast
often
heard
of

it
is
known
to
many
in
our
land
by
the
name
of

this
pitch

do
report
doth
defile
so
doth
the

thou
keepest
for
harry
now
i
do
not
speak
to
thee
in
drink
but
in
tears
not
in
pleasure
but
in
passion
not
in
words

but
in
woes
also
and
yet
there
is
a
virtuous
man
whom
i
have
often
noted
in
thy

i
know
not
his

think
his
age

fifty

by

inclining
to
three
score
and
now
i
remember
me
his
name
is
falstaff
if
that

should
be
lewdly
given
he
deceiveth
me
for
harry

see
virtue
in
his
looks
if
then
the
tree
may
be
known
by
the
fruit
as
the

peremptorily

he

you
in

as
oft
as
he

spoke
of

i
cannot
blame
him
at
my
nativity
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
of
burning
cressets
and
at
my
birth
the
frame
and
huge
foundation
of
the
earth
shaked
like
a
coward
hotspur
why
so
it
would
have
done
at
the

season
if
your
mother

cat
had
but
kittened
though
yourself
had
never
been
born
glendower
i
say
the
earth
did
shake
when
i
was
born
hotspur
and
i
say
the
earth
was
not
of
my
mind
if
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
glendower
the
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
hotspur
o
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire

continent
as
much
as
on
the
other

it
takes
from
you
earl

worcester
yea
but
a
little
charge
will
trench
him
here
and
on
this
north
side
win
this
cape
of
land
and
then
he
runs
straight

can
speak
english
lord
as
well
as

for
i
was
train
d
up
in
the
english
court
where
being
but
young
i
framed
to
the
harp
many
an
english
ditty
lovely
well
and
gave
the
tongue
a
helpful
ornament
a
virtue
that
was
never
seen
in
you
hotspur
marry
and
i
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
i
had
rather
be
a
kitten
and
cry
mew
than
one
of
these
same
metre
ballad
mongers
i
had
rather
hear
a
brazen
canstick
turn
d
or
a
dry
wheel
grate
on
the
axle
tree
and
that
would
set
my
teeth
nothing
on
edge
nothing
so
much
as
mincing
poetry
tis
like
the
forced
gait
of
a
shuffling
nag
glendower
come
you
shall
have
trent
turn
d
hotspur
i
do
not
care
i
ll
give
thrice
so
much
land
to
any
well
deserving
friend
but
in
the
way
of
bargain
mark
ye
me
i
ll
cavil
on
the
ninth
part
of
a
hair
are
the
indentures
drawn
shall
we
be
gone
glendower
the
moon
shines
fair
you
may
away
by
night
i
ll
haste
the
writer
and
withal
break
with
your
wives
of
your
departure
hence
i
am
afraid
my
daughter
will
run
mad
so
much
she
doteth
on
her
mortimer
exit
glendower
mortimer
fie
cousin
percy
how
you
cross
my
father
hotspur
i
cannot
choose
sometime
he
angers
me
with
telling
me
of
the
mouldwarp
and
the
ant
of
the
dreamer
merlin
and
his
prophecies
and
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
a
clip
wing
d
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
a
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
and
such
a
deal
of
skimble
skamble
stuff
as
puts
me
from
my
faith
i
tell
you
what
he
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
in
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
that
were
his
lackeys
i
cried
hum
and
well
go
to
but
mark
d
him
not
a
word
o
he
is
as
tedious
as
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
worse
than
a
smoky
house
i
had
rather
live
with
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
summer
house
in
christendom
mortimer
in
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
in
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
and
as
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
as
mines
of
india
shall
i
tell
you
cousin
he
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
and
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
when
you
come
cross
his
humour
faith
he
does
i
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof
but
do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
earl
of
worcester
in
faith
my
lord
you
are
too
wilful
blame
and
since
your
coming
hither
have
done
enough
to
put
him
quite
beside
his
patience
you
must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
blood
and
that
s
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
you
yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
defect
of
manners
want
of
government
pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
the
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
loseth
men
s
hearts
and
leaves
behind
a
stain
upon
the
beauty
of
all
parts
besides
beguiling
them
of
commendation
hotspur
well
i
am
school
d
good

and
let
us

she
answers
him
in
the
same
glendower
she
is
desperate
here
a
peevish
self

harlotry
one
that
no
persuasion
can
do

charming
your

with
pleasing
heaviness
making

for
we
shall
presently
have
need
of
you
exeunt
lords
i
know
not
whether
god
will
have
it
so
for
some
displeasing
service
i
have
done
that
in
his
secret
doom
out
of
my
blood
he
ll
breed
revengement
and
a
scourge
for
me
but
thou
dost
in
thy
passages

that
thou
art

prince
henry
so
please
your
majesty
i
would
i
could
quit
all
offences
with
as
clear
excuse
as
well
as
i
am
doubtless
i
can
purge
myself
of
many
i
am
charged
withal
yet
such
extenuation
let
me
beg
as
in
reproof
of
many
tales
devised
which
oft
the
ear
of
greatness
needs
must
hear
by
smiling
pick
thanks
and
base
news

i
may
for
some
things
true
wherein
my
youth
hath
faulty
wander
d
and
irregular
find
pardon
on
my
true
submission
king
henry
iv
god
pardon
thee
yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
thy
place
in
council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
and
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
the
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
is
ruin
d
and
the
soul
of
every
man
prophetically
doth
forethink
thy
fall
had
i
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
so
common
hackney
d
in
the
eyes
of
men
so
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
by
being
seldom
seen
i
could
not
stir
but
like
a
comet
i
was
wonder
d
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
this
is
he
others
would
say
where
which
is
bolingbroke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
and
dress
d
myself
in
such
humility
that
i
did
pluck
allegiance
from
men
s
hearts
loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
did
i
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
my
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
ne
er
seen
but
wonder
d
at
and
so
my
state
seldom
but
sumptuous
showed
like
a
feast
and
won
by
rareness
such
solemnity
the
skipping
king
he
ambled
up
and
down
with
shallow
jesters
and
rash
bavin
wits
soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
mingled
his
royalty
with
capering
fools
had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
and
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
to
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
enfeoff
d
himself
to
popularity
that
being
daily
swallow
d
by
men
s
eyes
they
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
to
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
more
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
so
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
he
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
june
heard
not
regarded
seen
but
with
such
eyes
as
sick
and
blunted
with
community
afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
such
as
is
bent
on
sun
like

my

four
days
ere

set
forth
and
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
he
was
much
fear
d
by
his
physicians
earl
of
worcester
i
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
his
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
hotspur
sick
now
droop
now
this
sickness
doth
infect
the
very
life
blood
of
our
enterprise
tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
he
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
and
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
so
soon
be
drawn
nor
did
he
think
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
on
any
soul
removed
but
on
his
own
yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
that
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
disposed
to
us
for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the
king
is
certainly
possess
d
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
earl
of
worcester
your
father
s
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
hotspur
a
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
lopp
d
off
and
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
his
present
want
seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
were
it
good
to
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
all
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
main
on
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
it
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
the
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
the
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
of
all
our
fortunes
earl
of
douglas
faith
and
so
we
should
where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
we
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
is
to
come
in
a
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
hotspur
a
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
if
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
earl
of
worcester
but
yet
i
would
your
father
had
been
here
the
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
brooks
no
division
it
will
be
thought
by
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
that
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
of
our
proceedings
kept
the
earl
from
hence
and
think
how
such
an
apprehension
may
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
and
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
for
well
you
know
we
of
the
offering
side
must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
and
stop
all
sight
holes
every
loop
from
whence
the
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
this
absence
of
your
father
s
draws
a
curtain
that
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
before
not
dreamt
of
hotspur
you
strain
too
far
i
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
it
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
a
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
than
if
the
earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
if
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
to
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
we
shall
o
erturn
it
topsy
turvy
down
yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints

whole

of
our
determination
some
of
us
love
you
well
and
even
those
some
envy
your
great
deservings
and
good
name
because
you
are
not
of
our
quality
but
stand
against
us
like
an
enemy
sir

and
god
defend
but
still
i
should
stand
so
so
long
as
out
of

and
true
rule
you
stand
against
anointed
majesty
but
to
my
charge
the
king
hath
sent
to
know
the
nature
of
your
griefs
and
whereupon
you
conjure
from
the
breast
of
civil
peace
such
bold
hostility
teaching
his
duteous
land
audacious
cruelty
if
that
the
king
have
any
way
your
good
deserts
forgot
which
he
confesseth
to
be
manifold
he
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
you
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
and
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
hotspur
the
king
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
king
knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
my
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
and
when
he
was
not
six
and
twenty
strong
sick
in
the
world
s
regard
wretched
and
low
a
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
my
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
and
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
god
he
came
but
to
be
duke
of
lancaster
to
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
with
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
my
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
moved
swore
him
assistance
and
perform
d
it
too
now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
perceived
northumberland
did
lean
to
him
the
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee
met
him
in
boroughs
cities

attended
him
on
bridges
stood
in
lanes
laid
gifts
before
him
proffer
d
him
their
oaths
gave
him
their
heirs
as
pages
follow
d
him
even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
he
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
upon
the
naked
shore
at
ravenspurgh
and
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform
some
certain
edicts
and
some
strait
decrees
that
lie
too
heavy
on
the
commonwealth
cries
out
upon
abuses
seems
to
weep
over
his
country
s
wrongs
and
by
this
face
this
seeming
brow
of
justice
did
he
win
the
hearts
of
all
that
he
did
angle

time
after

deposed
the
king
soon
after
that
deprived
him
of
his
life
and
in
the
neck
of
that
task
d
the
whole
state
to
make
that
worse
suffer
d
his
kinsman
march
who
is
if
every
owner
were
well
placed
indeed
his
king
to
be
engaged
in
wales
there
without
ransom
to
lie
forfeited
disgraced

in
my
happy
victories
sought
to
entrap
me
by
intelligence
rated
mine
uncle
from
the
council
board
in
rage
dismiss
d
my
father
from
the
court
broke
oath
on
oath
committed
wrong
on
wrong
and
in
conclusion
drove
us
to
seek
out
this
head
of
safety
and
withal
to
pry
into
his
title
the
which
we
find
too
indirect
for
long
continuance
sir
walter
blunt
shall
i
return
this
answer
to
the
king
hotspur
not
so
sir
walter
we
ll
withdraw
awhile
go

be
impawn
d
some

for
a
safe

and
sir
michael
archbishop
of

hie
good
sir
michael
bear
this
sealed
brief
with
winged
haste
to
the
lord
marshal
this
to
my
cousin
scroop
and
all
the
rest
to
whom
they
are
directed
if
you
knew
how
much
they
do
to
import
you
would
make
haste
sir
michael
my
good
lord
i
guess
their
tenor
archbishop
of
york
like
enough
you
do
to
morrow
good
sir
michael
is
a
day
wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
shrewsbury
as
i
am
truly
given
to
understand
the
king
with
mighty
and
quick
raised
power
meets
with
lord
harry
and
i
fear
sir
michael
what
with
the
sickness
of
northumberland
whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
and
what
with
owen
glendower
s
absence
thence
who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
and
comes
not
in
o
er
ruled
by
prophecies
i
fear
the
power
of
percy
is
too
weak
to
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
king
sir
michael
why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
there
is
douglas
and
lord
mortimer
archbishop
of
york
no
mortimer
is
not
there
sir
michael
but
there
is
mordake
vernon
lord
harry
percy
and
there
is
my
lord
of
worcester
and
a
head
of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
archbishop
of
york
and
so
there
is
but
yet
the
king
hath
drawn
the
special
head
of
all
the
land
together
the
prince
of
wales
lord
john
of
lancaster
the
noble
westmoreland
and
warlike
blunt
and
moe
corrivals
and
dear
men
of
estimation
and
command
in
arms
sir
michael
doubt
not
my
lord
they
shall
be
well
opposed
archbishop
of
york
i
hope
no
less
yet
needful
tis
to
fear
and
to
prevent
the
worst
sir
michael
speed
for
if
lord
percy
thrive
not
ere
the
king
dismiss
his
power
he
means
to
visit
us
for
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
and
tis
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against
him
therefore
make
haste
i
must
go
write
again
to
other
friends
and
so
farewell

how
bloodily
the
sun
begins
to
peer
above
yon
busky
hill
the
day
looks
pale
at
his
distemperature
prince
henry
the
southern
wind
doth
play
the
trumpet
to
his
purposes
and
by
his
hollow
whistling
in
the
leaves
foretells
a
tempest
and
a
blustering
day
king
henry
iv
then
with
the
losers
let
it
sympathize
for
nothing
can
seem
foul
to
those
that
win
the
trumpet
sounds
enter
worcester
and
vernon
how
now
my
lord
of
worcester
tis
not
well
that
you
and
i
should
meet
upon
such
terms
as
now
we
meet
you
have
deceived
our
trust
and
made
us
doff
our
easy
robes
of
peace
to
crush
our
old
limbs
in
ungentle
steel
this
is
not
well
my
lord
this
is
not
well
what
say
you
to
it
will
you
again
unknit
this
curlish
knot
of
all
abhorred
war
and
move
in
that
obedient
orb
again
where
you
did
give
a
fair
and
natural
light
and
be
no
more
an
exhaled
meteor
a
prodigy
of
fear
and
a
portent
of
broached
mischief
to
the
unborn
times
earl
of
worcester
hear
me
my
liege
for
mine
own
part
i
could
be
well
content
to
entertain
the
lag
end
of
my
life
with
quiet
hours
for
i
do
protest
i
have
not
sought
the
day
of
this
dislike
king
henry
iv
you
have
not
sought
it
how
comes
it
then
falstaff
rebellion
lay
in
his
way
and
he
found
it
prince
henry
peace
chewet
peace
earl
of
worcester
it
pleased
your
majesty
to
turn
your
looks
of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our
house
and
yet
i
must
remember
you
my
lord
we
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
for
you
my
staff
of
office
did
i
break
in
richard
s
time
and
posted
day
and
night
to
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
when
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
i
it
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
that
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
the
dangers
of
the
time
you
swore
to
us
and
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
doncaster
that
you
did
nothing
purpose
gainst
the
state
nor
claim
no
further
than
your
new
fall
n
right
the
seat
of
gaunt
dukedom
of
lancaster
to
this
we
swore
our
aid
but
in
short
space
it
rain
d
down
fortune
showering
on
your
head
and
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
you
what
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
king
what
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
the
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
and
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
king
so
long
in
his
unlucky
irish
wars
that
all
in
england
did
repute
him
dead
and
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
you
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
woo
d
to
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
forget
your
oath
to
us
at
doncaster
and
being
fed
by
us
you
used
us
so
as
that
ungentle
hull
the
cuckoo
s
bird
useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
durst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
we
were
enforced
for
safety
sake
to
fly
out
of
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
as
you
yourself
have
forged
against
yourself
by
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
and
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
sworn
to
us
in
your
younger
enterprise
king
henry
iv
these
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
proclaim
d
at
market
crosses
read
in
churches
to
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
with
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
of
hurlyburly
innovation
and
never
yet
did
insurrection
want
such
water
colours
to
impaint
his
cause
nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
of
pellmell
havoc
and
confusion
prince
henry
in
both
your
armies
there
is
many
a
soul
shall
pay
full
dearly
for
this
encounter
if
once
they
join
in
trial
tell
your
nephew
the
prince
of
wales
doth
join
with
all
the
world
in
praise
of
henry
percy
by
my
hopes
this
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
i
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
more
active
valiant
or
more
valiant
young
more
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
to
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
for
my
part
i
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
i
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
and
so
i
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
yet
this
before
my
father
s
majesty
i
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
of
his
great
name
and
estimation
and
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight
king
henry
iv
and
prince
of
wales
so
dare
we
venture
thee
albeit
considerations
infinite
do
make
against
it
no
good
worcester
no
we
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
that
are
misled
upon
your
cousin

offer
of
our
grace

be
my
friend
again
and
i
ll
be
his
so
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
what
he
will
do
but
if
he
will
not
yield
rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
and
they
shall
do
their
office
so
be
gone
we
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply

that

or
take
away
the
grief
of
a

no

it
cannot
be
the

suspect
us
still
and
find
a
time
to
punish
this
offence
in
other
faults
suspicion
all

still
dispraising
praise

which
became
him
like
a
prince

made
a
blushing
cital
of
himself

chid
his
truant
youth
with
such
a
grace
as
if

there
a
double
spirit
of

not
the

to
counterfeit
dying
when
a

thereby
liveth
is
to
be
no
counterfeit
but
the
true
and
perfect
image
of
