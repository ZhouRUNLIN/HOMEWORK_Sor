to

have
you

or
hath

and
myself
with

council
of

studied
so
long
sat
in

house
early

debating
to

fro
how

might
be
kept
in
awe
and
had
his

in
his
infancy
crowned
in

bedford
s

and

o

shameful
is
this
league
fatal
this
marriage
cancelling
your
fame
blotting
your
names
from
books
of
memory
razing
the
characters
of
your
renown
defacing
monuments
of
conquer
d
france
undoing
all
as
all
had
never
been
cardinal
nephew
what
means
this
passionate
discourse
this
peroration
with
such
circumstance
for
france
tis
ours
and
we
will
keep
it
still
gloucester
ay
uncle
we
will
keep
it
if
we
can
but
now
it
is
impossible
we
should
suffolk
the
new
made
duke
that
rules
the
roast
hath
given
the
duchy
of
anjou
and
maine
unto
the
poor
king
reignier
whose
large
style
agrees
not
with
the
leanness
of
his
purse
salisbury
now
by
the
death
of
him
that
died
for
all
these
counties
were
the
keys
of
normandy
but
wherefore
weeps
warwick
my
valiant
son
warwick
for
grief
that
they
are
past
recovery
for
were
there
hope
to
conquer
them
again
my
sword
should
shed
hot
blood
mine
eyes
no
tears
anjou
and
maine
myself
did
win
them
both
those
provinces
these
arms
of
mine
did
conquer
and
are
the
cities
that
i
got
with
wounds
delivered
up
again
with
peaceful
words
mort
dieu
york
for
suffolk
s
duke
may
he
be
suffocate
that
dims
the
honour
of
this
warlike
isle
france
should
have
torn
and
rent
my
very
heart
before
i
would
have
yielded
to
this
league
i
never
read
but
england
s
kings
have
had
large
sums
of
gold
and
dowries
with
their
wives
and
our
king
henry
gives
away
his
own
to
match
with
her
that
brings
no
vantages
gloucester
a
proper
jest
and
never
heard
before
that
suffolk
should
demand
a
whole
fifteenth
for
costs
and
charges
in
transporting
her
she
should
have
stayed
in
france
and
starved
in
france
before
cardinal
my
lord
of
gloucester
now
ye
grow
too
hot
it
was
the
pleasure
of
my
lord
the
king
gloucester
my
lord
of
winchester
i
know
your
mind
tis
not
my
speeches
that
you
do
mislike
but
tis
my
presence
that
doth
trouble
ye
rancour
will
out
proud
prelate
in
thy
face
i
see
thy
fury
if
i
longer
stay
we
shall
begin
our
ancient
bickerings
lordings
farewell
and
say
when
i
am
gone
i
prophesied
france
will
be
lost
ere
long
exit
cardinal
so
there
goes
our
protector
in
a
rage
tis
known
to
you
he
is
mine
enemy
nay
more
an
enemy
unto
you
all
and
no
great
friend
i
fear
me
to
the
king
consider
lords
he
is
the
next
of
blood
and
heir
apparent
to
the
english
crown
had
henry
got
an
empire
by
his
marriage
and
all
the
wealthy
kingdoms
of
the
west
there
s
reason
he
should
be
displeased
at
it
look
to
it
lords
let
not
his
smoothing
words
bewitch
your
hearts
be
wise
and
circumspect
what
though
the
common
people
favour
him
calling
him
humphrey
the
good
duke
of
gloucester
clapping
their
hands
and
crying
with
loud
voice
jesu
maintain
your
royal
excellence
with
god
preserve
the
good
duke
humphrey
i
fear
me
lords
for
all
this
flattering
gloss
he
will
be
found
a
dangerous
protector
buckingham
why
should
he
then
protect
our
sovereign
he
being
of
age
to
govern
of
himself
cousin
of
somerset
join
you
with
me
and
all
together

though
humphrey
s
pride
and
greatness
of
his
place
be
grief
to
us
yet
let
us
watch
the
haughty
cardinal
his
insolence
is
more
intolerable
than
all
the
princes
in
the
land
beside
if
gloucester
be
displaced
he
ll
be
protector
buckingham
or
thou
or

exeunt
buckingham
and
somerset

went
before

him
while
these
do
labour
for
their

preferment
behoves
it
us
to
labour
for
the
realm
i
never
saw
but
humphrey
duke
of
gloucester
did
bear
him
like
a
noble
gentleman
oft
have
i
seen
the
haughty
cardinal
more
like
a
soldier
than
a
man
o
the
church
as
stout
and
proud
as
he
were
lord
of
all
swear
like
a
ruffian
and
demean
himself
unlike
the
ruler
of
a
commonweal
warwick
my
son
the
comfort
of
my
age
thy
deeds
thy
plainness
and
thy
housekeeping

won

commons
excepting
none
but
good

and
brother
york
thy
acts
in
ireland
in
bringing
them
to
civil
discipline
thy
late
exploits
done
in
the
heart
of

when
thou
wert

have
made
thee
fear
d
and
honour
d
of
the
people
join
we
together
for
the
public
good
in
what
we
can
to
bridle
and
suppress
the
pride
of
suffolk
and
the
cardinal
with
somerset
s
and
buckingham
s
ambition
and
as
we
may
cherish
duke
humphrey
s
deeds
while
they
do
tend
the
profit
of
the
land
warwick
so
god
help
warwick
as
he
loves
the
land
and
common
profit
of
his
country
york
[aside]
and
so
says
york
for
he
hath
greatest
cause
salisbury
then
let
s
make
haste
away
and
look
unto
the
main
warwick
unto
the
main
o
father
maine
is
lost
that
maine
which
by
main
force
warwick
did
win
and
would
have
kept
so
long
as
breath
did
last
main
chance
father
you
meant
but
i
meant
maine
which
i
will
win
from
france
or
else
be
slain
exeunt
warwick
and
salisbury
york
anjou
and
maine
are
given
to
the
french
paris
is
lost
the
state
of
normandy
stands
on
a
tickle
point
now
they
are
gone
suffolk
concluded
on
the
articles
the
peers
agreed
and
henry
was
well
pleased
to
change
two
dukedoms
for
a
duke
s
fair
daughter
i
cannot
blame
them
all
what
is
t
to
them
tis
thine
they
give
away
and
not
their
own
pirates
may
make
cheap
pennyworths
of
their
pillage
and
purchase
friends
and
give
to
courtezans
still
revelling
like
lords
till
all
be
gone
while
as
the
silly
owner
of
the
goods
weeps
over
them
and
wrings
his
hapless
hands
and
shakes
his
head
and
trembling
stands
aloof
while
all
is
shared
and
all
is
borne
away
ready
to
starve
and
dare
not
touch
his
own
so
york
must
sit
and
fret
and
bite
his
tongue
while
his
own
lands
are
bargain
d
for
and
sold
methinks
the
realms
of
england
france
and
ireland
bear
that
proportion
to
my
flesh
and
blood
as
did
the
fatal
brand
althaea
burn
d
unto
the
prince
s
heart
of
calydon
anjou

both
given
unto

hope
of
france
even
as
i
have
of
fertile
england
s
soil
a
day
will
come
when
york
shall
claim
his
own
and
therefore
i
will
take
the
nevils
parts
and
make
a
show
of
love
to
proud
duke
humphrey
and
when
i
spy
advantage
claim
the
crown
for

the
golden
mark

nor
wear

in

was
broke
in
twain
by
whom
i
have
forgot
but
as
i
think
it
was
by
the
cardinal
and
on
the
pieces
of
the
broken
wand
were
placed
the
heads
of
edmund
duke
of
somerset
and
william
de
la
pole
first
duke
of
suffolk
this
was
my
dream
what
it
doth
bode
god
knows
duchess
tut
this
was
nothing
but
an
argument
that
he
that
breaks
a
stick
of
gloucester
s
grove
shall
lose
his
head
for
his
presumption
but
list
to
me
my
humphrey
my
sweet
duke
methought
i
sat
in
seat
of
majesty
in
the
cathedral
church
of
westminster
and
in
that
chair
where
kings
and
queens
are
crown
d
where
henry
and

margaret
kneel
d
to
me
and
on
my

above
the
reach

of
thy
thought
and
wilt
thou
still
be
hammering
treachery
to
tumble
down
thy
husband
and
thyself
from
top
of
honour
to
disgrace
s
feet
away
from
me
and
let
me
hear
no
more

still
under

surly
gloucester

away
the

i
thought
king

resembled
thee
in

courtship

all
his

is
bent
to
holiness
to

his

his

are
brazen

i
would
the

would
choose
him
pope

carry
him

not
the

he
of

half
so

for
i
am
bold
to

you
in

although

join
with

with
the

till

have
brought

as
for

how

he
is
become
how
proud

if

glance
a

he

by

suffolk
well
hath
your
highness
seen
into
this
duke
and
had
i
first
been
put
to
speak
my
mind
i
think
i
should
have
told
your
grace
s
tale
the
duchess
by
his
subornation
upon
my
life
began
her
devilish
practises
or
if
he
were
not
privy
to
those
faults
yet
by
reputing
of
his
high
descent
as
next
the
king
he
was
successive
heir
and
such
high
vaunts
of
his
nobility
did
instigate
the
bedlam
brain
sick
duchess
by
wicked
means
to
frame
our
sovereign
s
fall
smooth
runs
the
water
where
the
brook
is
deep
and
in
his
simple
show
he
harbours
treason
the
fox
barks
not
when
he
would
steal
the
lamb
no
no
my
sovereign
gloucester
is
a
man
unsounded
yet
and
full
of
deep
deceit
cardinal
did
he
not
contrary
to
form
of
law
devise
strange
deaths
for
small
offences
done
york
and
did
he
not
in
his
protectorship
levy
great
sums
of
money
through
the
realm
for
soldiers
pay
in
france
and
never
sent
it
by
means
whereof
the
towns
each
day
revolted
buckingham
tut
these
are
petty
faults
to
faults
unknown
which
time
will
bring
to
light
in
smooth
duke
humphrey
king
henry
vi
my
lords
at
once
the
care
you
have
of
us
to
mow
down
thorns
that
would
annoy
our
foot
is
worthy
praise
but
shall
i
speak
my
conscience
our
kinsman
gloucester
is
as
innocent
from
meaning
treason
to
our
royal
person
as
is
the
sucking
lamb
or
harmless
dove
the
duke
is
virtuous
mild
and
too
well
given
to
dream
on
evil
or
to
work
my
downfall
queen
margaret
ah
what
s
more
dangerous
than
this
fond
affiance
seems
he
a
dove
his
feathers
are
but
borrowed
for
he
s
disposed
as
the
hateful
raven
is
he
a
lamb
his
skin
is
surely
lent
him
for
he
s
inclined
as
is
the
ravenous
wolf
who
cannot
steal
a
shape
that
means
deceit
take
heed
my
lord
the
welfare
of
us
all
hangs
on
the
cutting
short
that
fraudful
man
enter

somerset
all
health
unto
my
gracious
sovereign
king
henry

welcome

[aside]
cold
news
for
me
for
i
had
hope
of

as
firmly
as
i
hope
for
fertile
england
thus
are
my
blossoms
blasted
in
the
bud
and
caterpillars
eat
my
leaves
away
but
i
will
remedy
this
gear
ere
long
or
sell
my
title

a
glorious
grave

art
come
too
soon

thou
wert
more
loyal
than
thou
art
i
do
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
here
gloucester
well
suffolk
thou
shalt
not
see
me
blush
nor
change
my
countenance
for
this
arrest
a
heart
unspotted

not
easily
daunted
the
purest
spring
is
not
so
free
from
mud
as
i
am
clear
from
treason
to
my
sovereign
who
can
accuse
me
wherein
am
i
guilty
york
tis
thought
my
lord
that
you
took
bribes
of
france
and
being
protector
stayed
the
soldiers
pay
by
means
whereof
his
highness
hath
lost
france
gloucester
is
it
but
thought
so
what
are
they
that
think
it
i
never
robb
d
the
soldiers
of
their
pay
nor
ever
had
one
penny
bribe
from
france
so
help
me
god
as
i
have
watch
d
the
night
ay
night
by
night
in
studying
good
for
england
that
doit
that
e
er
i
wrested
from
the
king
or
any
groat
i
hoarded
to
my
use
be
brought
against
me
at
my
trial
day
no
many
a
pound
of
mine
own
proper
store
because
i
would
not
tax
the
needy
commons
have
i
disbursed
to
the
garrisons
and
never
ask
d
for
restitution
cardinal
it
serves
you
well
my
lord
to
say
so
much
gloucester
i
say
no
more
than
truth
so
help
me
god
york
in
your
protectorship
you
did
devise
strange
tortures
for
offenders
never
heard
of
that
england
was
defamed
by
tyranny
gloucester
why
tis
well
known
that
whiles
i
was
protector
pity
was
all
the
fault
that
was
in
me
for
i
should
melt
at
an
offender
s
tears
and
lowly
words
were
ransom
for
their
fault
unless
it
were
a
bloody
murderer
or
foul
felonious
thief
that
fleeced
poor
passengers
i
never
gave
them
condign
punishment
murder
indeed
that
bloody
sin
i
tortured
above
the
felon
or
what
trespass
else
suffolk
my
lord
these
faults
are
easy
quickly
answered
but
mightier
crimes
are
laid
unto
your
charge
whereof
you
cannot
easily
purge
yourself
i
do
arrest
you
in
his
highness
name
and
here
commit
you
to
my
lord
cardinal
to
keep
until
your
further
time
of
trial
king
henry
vi
my
lord
of
gloucester
tis
my
special
hope
that
you
will
clear
yourself
from
all
suspect
my
conscience
tells
me
you
are
innocent
gloucester
ah
gracious
lord
these
days
are
dangerous
virtue
is
choked
with
foul
ambition
and
charity
chased
hence
by
rancour
s
hand
foul
subornation
is
predominant
and
equity
exiled
your
highness
land
i
know
their
complot
is
to
have
my
life
and
if
my
death
might
make
this
island
happy
and
prove
the
period
of
their
tyranny
i
would
expend
it
with
all
willingness
but
mine
is
made
the
prologue
to
their
play
for
thousands
more
that
yet
suspect
no
peril
will
not
conclude
their
plotted
tragedy
beaufort

red
sparkling

with
his

the
envious

that
reaches
at

moon
whose
overweening
arm
i
have
pluck

at
my

you

free

cold
snow
melts
with
the
sun
s
hot
beams
henry
my
lord
is
cold
in
great
affairs
too
full
of
foolish
pity
and
gloucester
s
show
beguiles
him
as
the
mournful
crocodile
with
sorrow
snares
relenting
passengers
or
as

in

that
for

thinks

believe
me
lords
were
none
more
wise
than
i
and
yet
herein
i
judge
mine
own
wit
good
this
gloucester
should
be
quickly
rid
the
world
to
rid
us
of
the
fear
we
have
of
him
cardinal
that
he
should
die
is
worthy
policy
but
yet
we
want
a
colour
for
his
death
tis
meet
he
be
condemn
d
by
course
of
law
suffolk
but
in
my
mind
that
were
no
policy
the
king
will
labour
still
to
save
his
life
the
commons
haply
rise
to
save
his
life
and
yet
we
have
but
trivial
argument
more
than
mistrust
that
shows
him
worthy
death
york
so
that
by
this
you
would
not
have
him
die
suffolk
ah
york
no
man
alive
so
fain
as
i
york
tis
york
that
hath
more
reason
for
his
death
but
my
lord
cardinal
and
you
my
lord
of
suffolk
say
as
you
think
and
speak
it
from
your
souls
were
t
not
all
one
an
empty
eagle
were
set
to
guard
the
chicken
from
a
hungry
kite
as
place
duke
humphrey
for
the
king
s
protector
queen
margaret
so
the
poor
chicken
should
be
sure
of
death
suffolk
madam
tis
true
and
were
t
not
madness
then
to
make
the
fox
surveyor
of
the
fold
who
being
accused
a
crafty
murderer
his
guilt
should
be
but
idly
posted
over
because
his
purpose
is
not
executed
no
let
him
die
in
that
he
is
a
fox
by
nature
proved
an
enemy
to
the
flock
before
his
chaps
be
stain
d
with
crimson
blood
as
humphrey
proved
by
reasons
to
my
liege
and
do
not
stand
on
quillets
how
to
slay
him
be
it
by
gins
by
snares
by
subtlety
sleeping
or
waking
tis
no
matter
how
so
he
be
dead
for
that
is
good
deceit
which
mates
him
first
that
first
intends
deceit
queen
margaret
thrice
noble
suffolk
tis
resolutely
spoke
suffolk
not
resolute
except
so
much
were
done
for
things
are
often
spoke
and
seldom
meant
but
that
my
heart
accordeth
with
my
tongue
seeing
the
deed
is
meritorious
and
to
preserve
my
sovereign
from
his
foe
say
but
the
word
and
i
will
be
his
priest
cardinal
but
i
would
have
him
dead
my
lord
of
suffolk
ere
you
can
take
due
orders
for
a
priest
say
you
consent
and
censure
well
the
deed
and
i
ll
provide
his
executioner
i
tender
so
the
safety
of
my
liege
suffolk
here
is
my
hand
the
deed
is
worthy
doing
queen
margaret
and
so
say
i
york
and
i
and
now
we
three
have
spoke
it
it
skills
not
greatly

impugns
our
doom

stop

for

there
is
great
hope
of

well

i
seen
this
stubborn
cade
oppose
himself
against
a
troop
of
kerns
and
fought
so
long
till
that
his
thighs
with
darts
were
almost
like
a
sharp
quill
d
porpentine
and
in
the
end
being
rescued
i
have
seen
him
caper
upright
like
a
wild
morisco
shaking
the
bloody
darts
as
he
his
bells
full
often
like
a
shag

d
crafty
kern
hath
he
conversed
with
the
enemy
and
undiscover
d
come

given
me
notice
of
their
villanies

but
an
alehouse
sign
was
i
for
this
nigh
wreck
d
upon
the
sea
and
twice
by
awkward
wind
from
england
s
bank
drove
back
again
unto
my
native
clime
what
boded
this
but
well
forewarning
wind
did
seem
to
say
seek
not
a
scorpion
s
nest
nor
set
no
footing
on
this
unkind
shore
what
did
i
then
but
cursed
the
gentle
gusts
and
he
that
loosed
them
forth
their
brazen
caves
and
bid
them
blow
towards
england
s
blessed
shore
or
turn
our
stern
upon
a
dreadful
rock
yet
aeolus
would
not
be
a
murderer
but
left
that
hateful
office
unto
thee
the
pretty
vaulting
sea
refused
to
drown
me
knowing
that
thou
wouldst
have
me
drown
d
on
shore
with
tears
as
salt
as
sea
through
thy
unkindness
the
splitting
rocks
cower
d
in
the
sinking
sands
and
would
not
dash
me
with
their
ragged
sides
because
thy
flinty
heart
more
hard
than
they
might
in
thy
palace
perish
margaret
as
far
as
i
could
ken
thy
chalky
cliffs
when
from
thy
shore
the
tempest
beat
us
back
i
stood
upon
the
hatches
in
the
storm
and
when
the
dusky
sky
began
to
rob
my
earnest
gaping
sight
of
thy
land
s
view
i
took
a
costly
jewel
from
my
neck
a
heart
it
was
bound
in
with
diamonds
and
threw
it
towards
thy
land
the
sea
received
it
and
so
i
wish
d
thy
body
might
my
heart
and
even
with
this
i
lost
fair
england
s
view
and
bid
mine
eyes
be
packing
with
my
heart
and
call
d
them
blind
and
dusky
spectacles
for
losing
ken
of
albion
s
wished
coast
how
often
have
i
tempted
suffolk
s
tongue
the
agent
of
thy
foul
inconstancy
to
sit
and
witch
me
as
ascanius
did
when
he

laid
on

if
my
suspect

false
forgive

go
to
chafe
his
paly
lips
with
twenty
thousand
kisses
and
to
drain
upon
his
face
an
ocean
of
salt
tears
to
tell
my
love
unto
his
dumb
deaf
trunk
and
with
my
fingers
feel
his
hand
unfeeling
but
all
in
vain
are
these
mean
obsequies
and
to
survey
his
dead
and
earthly
image
what
were
it
but
to
make
my
sorrow
greater
re
enter
warwick
and
others
bearing
gloucester
s
body
on
a
bed
warwick
come
hither
gracious
sovereign
view
this
body
king
henry
vi
that
is
to
see
how
deep
my
grave
is
made
for
with
his
soul
fled
all
my
worldly
solace
for
seeing
him
i
see
my
life
in
death
warwick
as
surely
as
my
soul
intends
to
live
with
that
dread
king
that
took
our
state
upon
him
to
free
us
from
his
father
s
wrathful
curse
i
do
believe
that
violent
hands
were
laid
upon
the
life
of
this
thrice
famed
duke
suffolk
a
dreadful
oath
sworn
with
a
solemn
tongue
what
instance
gives
lord
warwick
for
his
vow
warwick
see
how
the
blood
is
settled
in
his
face
oft
have
i
seen
a
timely
parted
ghost
of
ashy
semblance
meagre
pale
and
bloodless
being
all
descended
to
the
labouring
heart
who
in
the
conflict
that
it
holds
with
death
attracts
the
same
for
aidance
gainst
the
enemy
which
with
the
heart
there
cools
and
ne
er
returneth
to
blush
and
beautify
the
cheek
again
but
see
his
face
is
black
and
full
of
blood
his
eye
balls
further
out
than
when
he
lived
staring
full
ghastly
like
a
strangled
man
his
hair
uprear
d
his
nostrils
stretched
with
struggling
his
hands
abroad
display
d
as
one
that
grasp
d
and
tugg
d
for
life
and
was
by
strength
subdued
look
on
the
sheets
his
hair
you
see
is
sticking
his
well
proportion
d
beard
made
rough
and
rugged
like
to
the
summer
s
corn
by
tempest
lodged
it
cannot
be
but
he
was
murder
d
here
the
least
of
all
these
signs
were
probable
suffolk
why
warwick
who
should
do
the
duke
to
death
myself
and
beaufort
had
him
in
protection
and
we
i
hope
sir
are
no
murderers
warwick
but
both
of
you
were
vow
d
duke
humphrey
s
foes
and
you
forsooth
had
the
good
duke
to
keep
tis
like
you
would
not
feast
him
like
a
friend
and
tis
well
seen
he
found
an
enemy
queen
margaret
then
you
belike
suspect
these
noblemen
as
guilty
of
duke
humphrey
s
timeless
death
warwick
who
finds
the
heifer
dead
and
bleeding
fresh
and

fast
by
a

an
axe
but
will
suspect
twas
he
that
made
the
slaughter
who
finds
the
partridge

may
imagine
how
the
bird
was
dead
although
the

ay
there

the

i

tis
true
the
elder

was
by
a
beggar
woman
stolen
away
and
ignorant
of
his

his

i

true

sir
he
made
a
chimney
in
my

base
drudge

words
that

that
my

up
fellow
kings
i
tell
you
that
that
lord
say
hath
gelded
the
commonwealth
and
made
it
an
eunuch
and
more
than
that
he
can
speak

therefore
he
is
